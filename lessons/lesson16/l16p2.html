                            <li>Tell students: <em>The rapid spread of new technologies allows people across the globe
                                    to benefit from new products and new, better, ways of creating them. This means that
                                    consumers across the world benefit from useful products that can dramatically
                                    improve their lives.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to discuss with a partner the opportunities that are likely to
                                come from the other trends listed in the table.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>You should ensure that you focus on &lsquo;wider opportunities&rsquo;
                                    that will occur to people generally, rather than just to those who own companies.
                                    You could also think about wider opportunities to societies.</em></li>
                            <li>Taking each trend at a time, ask for a volunteer to explain any opportunities they have
                                identified.</li>
                            <li>Discuss these as a class before clicking to reveal the examples given in the table.</li>

                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can anyone suggest a trend that illustrates globalisation which is not
                                    shown in the table?</em></li>
                            <li>Briefly invite students to share any ideas. For each additional trend identified,
                                encourage students to identify a likely wider opportunity. Record these points on the
                                board.</li>

                                        state in just days. Foods such as vegetables can be enjoyed at any time of the

                                    <li>The advent of the internet means that students have access to an almost infinite
                                        amount of knowledge via the web, whereas just 30 years ago they would have had
                                        to visit libraries and try to search for specific books or articles to find

                                    opportunities to businesses will be linked but, as you are studying Business, you
                                    should try and focus your thinking and analysis largely on businesses, their owners
                                    and workers.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>we have seen how globalisation can bring about general opportunities to
                                            people around the world. Now we are going to focus more specifically on the
                                            opportunities that arise for businesses.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>In 1972 a small company in Oregon, USA released its first ever sneaker or
                                            training shoe: the Moon Shoe. Fifty years later Nike earned revenues of
                                            nearly $45 billion and profits of $6 billion. This growth could not have
                                            occurred without globalisation.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>One of the key factors that allowed Nike to grow so quickly, from being a
                                            provider of track shoes to American college athletes to a worldwide sports
                                            brand, has been the way that globalisation has given the company access to
                                            much larger markets.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>China is now the company&rsquo;s second biggest market and is crucial to its
                                            future growth prospects. This is because average incomes in the country are
                                            rising rapidly and Chinese consumers are more exposed to global brands such
                                            as Nike through social media and worldwide sports events. This includes the
                                            American NBA Basketball on TV, and so consumers are exposed to Nike&rsquo;s
                                            high levels of sponsorship of the sport.</em></li>

                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to identify some of the specific opportunities that Nike might
                                receive directly from the larger market that globalisation offers it. They should work
                                individually, writing in their exercise books. Stress that for part (b) of the question
                                you want to see well-developed explanations.</li>
                            <li>Ask a student to identify an opportunity. Ask further students to identify the other
                                opportunities (Answers: a, f, g, h)</li>

                            <li>Explain to students: <em>The bold text represents the opportunities of operating
                                    globally for Nike, while the underlined text shows features that drive
                                    globalisation. The remaining statements are generally seen as threats to selling
                                    products in different countries.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask a student for a suggestion about how one of the opportunities arises.</li>
                            <li>Possible answers:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Selling the same product in many markets means far more products are supplied,
                                        therefore companies can use specialist production machinery which reduces the
                                        average cost of making each product. This is an example of an economy of scale
                                        when producing goods.</li>
                                    <li>Offering the same product to consumers in many places allows companies to
                                        receive revenue from a range of countries, so if one market experiences an
                                        increase in competition or a recession, the others can hopefully cover for any
                                        reduction in sales.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Different opportunities are often interlinked. For example,
                                    when</em><em>considering the impact of an increased market size on costs, we saw on
                                    the slide that a larger market may allow a business to benefit from economies of
                                    scale. </em></li>
                            <li><em>If preparing an explanation, you could simply state a &lsquo;reduction in
                                    costs&rsquo; as a separate opportunity of globalisation for large companies or you
                                    could continue with the earlier analysis to link to those lower costs and develop
                                    your argument further. For example, you could explain that lower costs allow a
                                    business to be more competitive against other rivals that do not experience those
                                    cost advantages. </em></li>
                            <li><em>If a company like Nike benefits from economies of scale, they could spend the
                                    additional revenue on sponsoring star athletes who are recognised across the world
                                    and so associate themselves with the sporting success of those athletes and increase
                                    sales of sports clothing. </em></li>
                            <li><em>Alternatively, large companies such as Nike could use their lower costs to create a
                                    <strong>competitive advantage </strong>by sponsoring global events like the World
                                    Cup which only the largest companies can do because it is so expensive. However, the
                                    benefit of doing so is that virtually every country in the world televises the
                                    competition and so its &lsquo;reach&rsquo; is massive.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you think of any other opportunities to businesses of
                                    globalisation?</em></li>

                                    <li>If consumer tastes become more universal as a result of globalisation and
                                        increased communication between countries, it will be simpler to sell the same

                                        workers to choose from and so this increased supply means that wages can remain

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Another way that multinational companies benefit from globalisation
                                    is the opportunity to pay less tax. Large companies increasingly choose to base
                                    themselves in the country which offers the lowest rate of tax on profits made there.
                                    For example, Apple has large parts of its European business in Ireland where the
                                    rate of corporation tax is 12.5%. If those activities were taking place in France or
                                    Germany, they would have to pay 28.4% or 29.9% of profits in tax.</em></li>
                            <li><em>This shows how globalisation, and the opportunities it offers to businesses to
                                    choose where they base themselves, can have a large impact on how much money the
                                    owners of the business can receive.</em></li>

                                    \(\frac{1424\;\mathrm{million}}{100}\times21.4=304.736\;\mathrm{million}\)</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;One important opportunity that producers like Samsung, Apple and Huawei might
                                    benefit from is lower costs. If businesses are able to grow by increasing output to
                                    larger markets, they may be able to lower their costs. This is because as firms grow
                                    they can exploit economies of scale. These are the cost reductions that firms can
                                    enjoy
                                    as they grow. With lower costs businesses will become more competitive. This might
                                    help
                                    them to win a larger share of the market, increase sales and profit margins. In this
                                    case, with sales of over 300 million sets, Samsung should be able to exploit
                                    economies
                                    of scale.</li>
                                Another important benefit of globalisation to such businesses is access to huge markets.
                                Clearly global markets are considerably larger than domestic markets. If a business has
                                access to several billion customers rather than, say, 40 million, this provides huge
                                opportunities to increase sales. Therefore, access to global markets provides growth
                                opportunities for businesses. This should result in much higher sales revenue and an
                                increase profits.

                                    <li><em>Globalisation has allowed multinational companies to grow far larger, often
                                            using economies of scale to reduce prices. This has meant that some small

                                            product launches that larger companies can afford. This means that those
                                            small companies find it more and more difficult to survive due to the
                                            greater competition they face from large multinationals.</em></li>

                                            campaigns which appeal to consumers who are used to seeing advertising from
                                            global brands on social media. This has meant that many small companies can

                                            was estimated that the closure was holding up $6.7 million worth of global
                                            trade every <strong>minute</strong>. Given that the ship was stuck for
                                            almost a week, many businesses across the world were badly affected.</li>

                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 2</strong> some students may struggle to think about how an
                                external shock in a distant country can affect small businesses elsewhere. Suggest
                                students think of a specific example of a business (such as Toyota) which relies on the
                                import of computer chips from Japan and think about how any disruption of supply might
                                affect that business, its workers its other suppliers and customers</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2, </strong>some students may struggle to think of aspects of
                                globalisation that may affect businesses when answering Question 1 on Worksheet 2.
                                Suggest that they look at the bullet points on pp. 65‒67 of the <strong>Student
                                    Book</strong> which list features of and reasons for globalisation. They could also
                                check their notes from earlier in this lesson about opportunities and threats of
                                globalisation and select the impacts they feel will be greatest on the business they
                                have chosen.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2</strong>, Worksheet 2, some students may struggle to come up
                                with what to write as an explanation for Question 3. An example answer might be:</li>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li>The reduction in costs of transporting materials may impact a business because it
                                    needs cheap supplies in order to remain competitive. This would be an opportunity
                                    for a business because they could buy goods internationally rather than from more
                                    expensive domestic suppliers. This would allow them to reduce costs and so cheaper
                                    prices can be offered to attract more customers.</li>
