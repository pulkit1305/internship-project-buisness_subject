                            <li>This activity is intended to recap the financial objectives material from <strong>Lesson
                                    1</strong> and introduce non-financial objectives as the first topic for
                                today&rsquo;s lesson.</li>
                            <li>Distribute <strong>Worksheet 1</strong> and ask students to complete question 1. They
                                should tick the relevant column for each objective.</li>

                            <li>Ask for reasons for any objective which a student has categorised differently from the
                                suggested answers below &ndash; some of these are subjective, so allowing students to
                                justify their ideas allows them to demonstrate a higher-order skill.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to complete question 2. They should write an objective of their own for
                                each of the categories on the worksheet.</li>
                            <li>Explain that the majority of objectives contain some element that is non-financial, and
                                those objectives will be the main focus of today&rsquo;s lesson.</li>
                            <li>If time permits, ask volunteers to suggest their own ideas for financial objectives. Use
                                these suggestions to refer back to Lesson 1. Ask students: <em>Can anyone tell me
                                    whether these objectives relate to profit, sales, market share, survival or
                                    financial security?</em></li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Think about why someone might want to run their own business rather
                                    than work for someone else. Focus on <strong>non-financial</strong> reasons, as
                                    these are our focus for today.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask volunteers to share suggestions. Then show Slide 1 of <strong>Slideshow: Freelance
                                    or employed?</strong>, which includes some possible answers.</li>

                            <li>Explain that many of the student suggestions can fit into three categories of
                                (non-financial) objective that can be described as:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>personal satisfaction</li>
                                    <li>challenge</li>
                                    <li>independence and control.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Show Slide 2 of the slideshow and ask students to: <em>Sort the suggestions into one or
                                    more of those categories. </em>Give students 2 minutes to do this.</li>
                            <li>If any students finish early, ask them whether they can think of any businesses/people
                                who have started companies for those reasons and, if so, to describe the company and the
                                type of non-financial objective they think the owner had (they may have family members
                                who have done so or know of commercial examples).<br />(Possible answers for the sorting
                                activity could include:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Personal satisfaction &ndash; being creative, having an impact on the world,
                                        gain prestige etc.</li>
                                    <li>Challenge &ndash; proving something, having an impact on the world, personal
                                        development</li>
                                    <li>Independence and control &ndash; being their own boss, able to make decisions,
                                        exert power, freedom)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Briefly ask whether any students were able to provide an example &ndash; look to take
                                one in each category.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Those three types of non-financial objective all relate to the
                                    individuals within a company (often the owner(s)) but another type of non-financial
                                    objective is a &lsquo;<strong>social objective</strong>&rsquo; &ndash; these are
                                    objectives which benefit a wider range of people or issues than just those relating
                                    to the owner or individuals <strong>within</strong> the business.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>All types of non-financial objectives are relevant to the owners of
                                    larger businesses. For example, growing smaller businesses into large ones can be a
                                    real source of challenge and lead to personal satisfaction.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that the type of business and its owner will influence its non-financial
                                objectives and how much influence these have on the business&rsquo;s overall aims.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>In this subject, you will also hear &lsquo;businesses&rsquo; referred
                                    to as &lsquo;firms&rsquo;. This is just another word for a business and you can use
                                    either.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Big firms which are owned by a large number of different people may
                                    focus more on financial objectives such as profits. On the other hand, many smaller
                                    companies are set up and grown by people who want to achieve social objectives: that
                                    means they want to improve human well-being or safeguard the natural environment. It
                                    is still common in large firms for there to be a focus on both non-financial and
                                    financial objectives. For example, Apple has successfully achieved many financial
                                    objectives but has also focused on achieving the UN&rsquo;s Global Climate Action
                                    award for its use of 100% green energy.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that firms can belong either to the private or the public sector.
                                <strong>Private sector</strong> firms are run by individuals for their own motives,
                                whether financial or non-financial. <strong>Public sector</strong> firms are run by the
                                government on behalf of the people of the country.</li>
                            <li>Show <strong>Question 1</strong> and ask students to discuss the categorisations with
                                their partner for 2 minutes. Choose a few pairs to justify their choices and look for
                                understanding of the public and private sectors as explained above.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can anyone explain what type of objectives the school or hospital is
                                    likely to have?</em> (Possible answers: Providing education/helping sick people).
                            </li>
                            <li>Summarise and suggest that many of these objectives are likely to be seen as social
                                objectives because they focus on improving some aspect of other people&rsquo;s lives.
                                Some students may give financial objectives. These are not incorrect, but social
                                objectives may be of more importance to the public sector.</li>
                            <li>Explain that in the public sector, firms generally aim to provide a service to the
                                people who live in that society: for example, almost all countries have a police force
                                run by the government with the objective of keeping the public safe from crime.</li>
                            <li>Explain that some firms which are not public sector organisations also focus on social
                                objectives. Examples include charities such as Water.org, which was set up with an
                                objective of ensuring access to safe water and sanitation in 13 of the poorest countries
                                in the world.</li>
                            <li>Introduce the idea of corporate social responsibility by telling students: <em>More and
                                    more firms are focusing on non-financial objectives such as worker welfare,
                                    environmental impact or charitable donations. This could be because these activities
                                    create a positive image of the firm in the public&rsquo;s view and may lead to
                                    increased sales or profit, or just out of a genuine sense of commitment to being
                                    good corporate citizens.</em></li>

                                    need to provide a basic answer to the question, which will usually be in the form of

                            <li>Tell students that a first step might be to explain why motivation will improve and then

                            <li>Ask for a student to give a full-length answer to the question and ask the rest of the
                                class to listen closely to identify whether there are three distinct
                                &lsquo;elements&rsquo; to the question which could each be awarded a mark. (In the
                                manner they critiqued the answer to the previous question (Slides 3 and 4)). (Possible
                                answers might include &lsquo;&hellip;motivated (1 mark) to do a better job because they

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Another type of command word is &lsquo;outline&rsquo;. This requires

                            <li>Click on Slide 8 and show an example of a &lsquo;calculate&rsquo; question. Tell
                                students: <em>This question type is more straightforward: you simply need to calculate a

                                    to present your answer &ndash; you might be asked to give your answer to 2 decimal

                                revenue, then try and identify which of the four items in the table fit which category
                                before finally applying the formula (which can be given to them if they cannot remember
                                it from <strong>Lesson 1</strong>).</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Worksheet 3</strong>, question 3, if students struggle with the calculation
                                (calculating market shares), explain that &lsquo;market leader&rsquo; simply means the
                                firm with the largest market share so will be the company that sells more boats (or in
                                other instances had sold the greatest value of goods). Then direct students to p. 286 of
                                the <strong>Student Book</strong>, where a formula is given for calculating market
                                share, and explain that the market leader&rsquo;s sales volume would be the numerator
                                and the sum of all sales in the market would be the denominator.</li>
