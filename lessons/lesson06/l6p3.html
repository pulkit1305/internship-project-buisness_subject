                                        <li>This is a unique investment opportunity because we target

                                        <li>New investors are sought to help finance the initial launch of the
                                            business and then to expand it quickly into the two other largest
                                            cities in the country. Investors will become shareholders, entitled

                                        <li>We are seeking up to five new investors to invest &pound;20,000
                                            each. This would entitle each new owner to a 5% share of the
                                            business and if we hit our profit target for year 1 they would
                                            immediately have received 37.5% of their initial investment back by
                                            this point.</li>
