                            <li>Explain why this is important: <em>Many of the features of businesses we looked at in
                                    the last lesson are different from those businesses we will look at today. Being
                                    able to compare and contrast those features or differences will be important when

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Sole traders are small businesses. When a business needs to raise
                                    finance to grow it usually means the business will change its legal structure,
                                    either to take on partners or to incorporate and become a company. A sole trader
                                    does not have a legally separate identity to the business and so they have unlimited
                                    liability. It is simple and inexpensive to set up as a sole trader, and an advantage
                                    of being a small business is that personal service can be offered to customers.</em>

                        <h4>The features of a private limited company</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Our starter exercise recapped the key features of unincorporated
                                    companies which have unlimited liability.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Today we will start to look at incorporated businesses: that is
                                    companies which have a separate legal identity from that of their owners. Because
                                    incorporated companies are seen as distinct from their owners, those owners are not
                                    liable for the debts of the company.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer to suggest an answer to the question: <em>What would we call this
                                    situation where the owners are not liable to repay the debts of a business if it
                                    becomes bankrupt? </em>(Answer: Limited liability)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <strong><em>Limited liability</em></strong><em> means that the
                                    responsibility of the owners to repay any debts the business owes is limited to just
                                    the money that an owner has already invested in the company. This means that the
                                    owners would not be forced to pay money from their own bank accounts or to sell
                                    their personal possessions such as cars or houses if their company goes out of
                                    business or if they owe money to other companies or individuals.</em></li>
                            <li>Display the <strong>Slideshow: The features of a private limited company</strong> and
                                click on Slide 1. Tell students to make a note of the information in their exercise
                                books.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>LINK</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain to students that in the UK, <strong>private</strong><strong>limited
                                    companies</strong> have the word &lsquo;limited&rsquo; after their name (for example
                                Dyson limited is a UK-based producer of vacuum cleaners and other products). Limited is
                                often abbreviated to ltd.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Although Dyson is a very large business that sells in many countries
                                    around the world, most <strong>limited companies</strong> are small businesses.
                                    However, a few large companies do choose to remain as private limited companies,
                                    such as LEGO in Denmark and Mars in the USA.</em></li>
                            <li>For the next point, you will need to have researched what the equivalent form of company
                                ownership in your country is called. For example, in Malaysia it would be Sendirian
                                Berhad (Sdn Bhd).</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>In our country, the equivalent to a UK private limited company is
                                    called a _____. However, any exam questions you are asked will focus on the UK form
                                    of ltd company ownership as we follow a British curriculum.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2 and tell students to make a note of the information on it.</li>
                            <li>Explain that the owners of a limited company are referred to as shareholders and this is
                                because they own a certain portion or &lsquo;share&rsquo; of the company. Many really
                                small ltds are owned by just one shareholder who will therefore be said to have a 100%
                                shareholding.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Private limited companies are often owned by members of a family who
                                    own and manage the business together. These owners are often also the directors of
                                    the company because they form the management team, making all of the key decisions
                                    together.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                            <li>Go through each feature one by one. For each feature, ask students to use mini
                                whiteboards or pieces of paper to identify the most appropriate legal structure. Tell
                                them to write &lsquo;ST&rsquo; for &lsquo;sole trader&rsquo; or &lsquo;ltd&rsquo; for
                                &lsquo;private limited company&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Ensure all students have got the answers right and correct any misunderstandings.</li>

                            <li>Click on SlideClick on Slide 4 and tell students to make a note of the information on
                                it.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>There are some more important features of a limited company which are
                                    different to a sole trader. These are that they can sell shares, which is an
                                    important way of raising finance and may allow the company to grow more easily. This
                                    finance is sometimes called &lsquo;capital&rsquo; for the business. The shareholders
                                    of private limited companies also elect one or more directors to run the business on
                                    their behalf, but in smaller companies they might carry out this role themselves.
                                </em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Because an incorporated business has a separate legal identity to the
                                    owners, the business itself pays tax on its profits. This is called corporation tax.
                                    In an unincorporated business there is no distinction between the company and the
                                    owner, so sole traders and partners pay personal tax on the profits they make from
                                    their business. This is called income tax.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>One of the reasons that some sole traders choose that form of
                                    ownership is because it is the simplest form of business to set up. Becoming
                                    incorporated as a &lsquo;proper&rsquo; company with a separate legal identity to the
                                    owners is more complicated and involves completing two documents, sending them to
                                    the government and paying a small fee.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that this is what is referred to in the last bullet point of Slide 4 as the
                                &lsquo;set-up process&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 5 and show students the information about the documents used to set up an
                                incorporated company. Explain that they do not need to know a huge amount of detail
                                about either of these forms.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 6.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to use mini whiteboards to show the three correct answers. They can write
                                down the relevant letters.</li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the answers one at a time: <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>,
                                <strong>E</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Explain to students: <em>Although private limited companies need to complete a tax
                                    return they will do so only after they have been in business for a year and so know
                                    how much profit they have made and therefore, how much tax they should pay.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>VAT registration (in the UK) is not mandatory for private limited
                                    companies and many small ones will not need to register if they do not earn enough
                                    revenue.</em></li>

                                &pound;600,000 in total for all the companies that are seeking investment; there may be
                                roughly 15 companies depending on how many are sole traders or partnerships).</li>
                            <li>Give each &lsquo;business&rsquo; three sticky notes and tell them they have 6 minutes to
                                complete the first part of the activity. Tell students:<em> When you have decided on
                                    your &lsquo;sales pitch&rsquo; you need to put those details onto your three sticky
                                    notes. You will not be given any more so make sure you get it right first time! You
                                    will need to be very concise in what you write.</em></li>
                            <li>One minute before the students&rsquo; 6-minute time-limit is up, warn them that any
                                company that has not put its &lsquo;sales pitch&rsquo; onto the board will miss the
                                opportunity to seek finance and investors.</li>
                            <li>After 6 minutes, tell students to come up and stick their sticky notes onto the board to
                                &lsquo;advertise&rsquo; to the investors.</li>
                            <li>You may wish to take a photograph of the sticky notes students have posted on the board
                                in case students need to refer back to their businesses in a future lesson
                                (<strong>Lesson 14</strong>).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You may wish to give students more time to complete <strong>Task 1</strong> and they
                                will potentially have a lot of pitches to read in this follow-up task, <strong>Task
                                    2</strong>. There are two options:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Option 1: Run the task as described below, with students working at speed and to
                                        a tight focus.</li>
                                    <li>Option 2: Allow students more time to read the pitches on the board. This likely
                                        to mean that you will need to run this lesson over two sessions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>You are now potential investors, rather than working in your
                                    business. Come up to the board in small groups to decide if you want to invest your
                                    &pound;20,000 into any of the companies.</em></li>
                            <li>Display the <strong>Slideshow:</strong><strong>Task 2</strong> and go through the
                                information with students.</li>

                            <li>Tell students that you will choose who comes up and in what order, but that no-one is
                                allowed to touch the board and if they do so they will be barred from investing. Explain
                                that they will only have 60 seconds (the time it takes an elevator to reach the top
                                floor of a very tall tower block) to make their decisions so they will probably only
                                have time to quickly scan the pitches. When students have made their decision, they
                                should note down the name/s of the company/companies and how much they want to invest.
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>You may want to split your &pound;20,000 between multiple companies.
                                    This might mean those</em><em>companies will seek other shareholders who will
                                    provide them with larger amounts of money.</em></li>
                            <li>You should know from the sales pitches how much each business is seeking in investment.
                                If this is not clear, check with any of those missing. Ask the four students whose
                                companies are seeking the least amount of investment to come up to the board first.</li>
                            <li>After 60 seconds, bring the next group of students up to the board and continue to
                                rotate groups every 60 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Remind students: <em>While you wait for your turn to come up to the board, you should be
                                    writing questions in your exercise books that you would want to ask the owners of
                                    the companies you are interested in investing in to help you make decisions.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Remind them: <em>Once you have selected companies you are interested in investing in,
                                    you should update your questions based on the specific information you know about
                                    the companies.</em></li>

                                the difference between a private limited company and a partnership. Explain that a ltd
                                is an arrangement that provides more protection to its owners, but that, in return,
                                those owners need to be bound by more rules about reporting results, sharing information
                                with rivals and the public and have to pay tax in a different way. You could also refer
                                students to Table 4.1 on p. 29 of the <strong>Student Book</strong> showing advantages
                                and disadvantages of a private limited company.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Task 1 </strong>of<strong> Student work 1,</strong> some students may
                                struggle with coming up with a &lsquo;pitch&rsquo;. Suggest they think about the
                                opportunities their business presents for someone else by thinking about what attracted
                                them to start that sort of company in the first place.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Task 2 </strong>of<strong> Student work 1, </strong>some students may

                                need to think about what happens if there are disputes, how profits and responsibilities
                                will be divided etc. There are also prompts in the <strong>Student Book</strong>: p. 29

                            <li>Tell students to make a note of the advantages in their exercise books. Explain bullets
                                two and three in more detail:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Shareholders can decide if they want to look for new owners to help run and
                                        expand the business and to potentially bring in new investment. Most private
                                        limited companies will share profits between the shareholders in the same ratio
                                        that they each invested money into the company. This means that if one person
                                        initially put in &pound;100,000 and later, two other shareholders joined and
                                        each contributed &pound;50,000 then the first shareholder would usually get 50%
                                        of all of the profits and the other two would each get 25%. It may also be
                                        agreed that the 50% shareholder gets two votes on major decisions while the
                                        other shareholders only get one each but this is up to the owners to decide.
                                        Explain that this is not always the case (and would usually be set out in the
                                        Articles of Association) because sometimes, if a shareholder is providing more
                                        expertise, has contributed some of their personal assets such as a car or
                                        machinery, they may be given more shares than another owner.</li>
                                    <li>If ownership is not shared equally, companies usually create a larger number of
                                        shares to reflect the greater contribution that one shareholder might be making
                                        and the profits would usually be split, based on the proportion of the total
                                        amount of shares that each person holds.</li>
                                    <li>Tell students: <em>For example, I might want to set up a private limited company
                                            that offers motivational speaking. If I asked a well-known sportsperson to
                                            be a shareholder in the business they might not contribute any money to set
                                            up the business, leaving me to inject all of the money needed. I might also
                                            work full-time in the business, while they would just spend an hour or two
                                            every week delivering the motivational speeches but we might share an equal
                                            shareholding and share profits equally.</em></li>
                                    <li>Tell them: <em>This might seem an unusual or unfair balance but I might be very
                                            happy with this arrangement because the sportsperson is contributing their
                                            celebrity status and that would attract far more business to the company
                                            than if I ran it on my own, hence it would be a good arrangement for both
                                            shareholders.</em></li>
                                    <li>Tell them: <em>We would also enjoy the benefit of being able to decide who we
                                            did or did not want to admit into the company as new shareholders. For
                                            example, we might also decide to offer a share to another well-known person
                                            because of the interest they would create in our business. However, if
                                            someone unknown asked to join the business we could reject that request if
                                            we wanted to, even if they were willing to pay a vast amount of money.</em>

                                    <li>Tell them: <em>Therefore, the shareholders get to retain full control of their

                                (<strong>Student work 1</strong>) might give them some ideas or they could think about
                                some of the advantages of being an unincorporated business and whether being a ltd might
                                mean those benefits are lost and so become &lsquo;disadvantages&rsquo; of this form of
                                ownership.</li>

                                    <li>If owners decide to bring in new shareholders, they may receive investment but
                                        will have to share the profits the company makes with more people and they will
                                        also have to share decision-making responsibility with those people.</li>
                                    <li>This can be good and bad as it helps to spread workload and responsibility but
                                        can lead to disputes. Therefore, setting out how to manage the company via the
                                        Memorandum and Articles of Association is crucial.</li>
                                    <li>It is not necessarily easy to find people who want to become shareholders as
                                        they will usually have to contribute money and take some role in running the
                                        company. (<strong>Lesson 7</strong> looks at how some larger companies can solve

                                small chance that the business will end up losing or owing lots of money and so there is
                                little benefit for unlimited liability. Explain that students may want to compare the

                                decisions about whether the advantages are greater than the disadvantages.</li>

                            <li>Two key sets of documents are needed before a business can trade as a limited company.
                                These include the memorandum of association and the articles of association.</li>
                            <li>Khan Sugar Mills Ltd is a private limited company. It is a family business and is owned
                                by three brothers, a venture capitalist called FarmVent and some of the senior managers.
                                Three quarters of the company is owned by the Khan brothers &ndash; Abdul, Mohsin and
                                Nabil; they each own 25 per cent of the shares. FarmVent own 20 per cent of the company
                                while senior managers have a small 5 per cent interest. Since the three brothers own
                                three-quarters of the company, together they have complete control over the company.
                            </li>
                            <li>Private limited companies, such as Khan Sugar Mills Ltd, enjoy a number of advantages.
                                One significant advantage is that the company cannot be taken over by outsiders. This is
                                because the shares are not on open sale. Shares in private limited companies cannot be
                                transferred without the permission of the other shareholders. They cannot be bought on
                                the stock market. This is because only shares in PLCs can be traded on the stock market.
                                Therefore, Khan Sugar Mills Ltd is safe from an unwanted takeover. Another advantage is
                                that all of the shareholders have limited liability. This means that they can only lose
                                the amount of money they originally invested in the company if it were to collapse. Khan
                                Sugar Mills Ltd&rsquo;s shareholders cannot be made to use personal wealth to pay off
                                business debts. Limited liability means they enjoy legal protection from business
                                creditors.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">It may be difficult to raise the amount of money needed to expand
                            the company beyond its one factory in Multan if the brothers decide they wish to do so. This
                            is because ltds can only access share capital from a small pool of owners, unlike plcs who
                            can sell additional shares on the stock market to raise large amounts of money to fund
                            expansion.</p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">There is potential for disputes among the owners because some
                            senior managers have a shareholding in the company and so if the family (or FarmVent) wish
                            to cut costs by reducing the number of managers or staff, they may not be able to achieve
                            this if the managers who own shares do not agree to the changes.</p>

The question <strong>must</strong> relate to one of the features of the legal structure of the business, how additional investment would affect that legal structure or some other feature relating to ownership, such as how the additional finance might be used, how profits will be shared, decisions made etc.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>You are going to write down how much money you wish to invest and the name of the company you wish to invest it in. You have &pound;20,000 to spend and you should aim to invest it all. You can invest in more than one company. Write your name and your &lsquo;bids&rsquo; down on your sticky note. If you want to invest in more than one company, rip the sticky note in half and write an amount on both halves, but remember that you are less likely to be accepted as a shareholder if the current owners get bids for more than the amount they are seeking.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students to give you their sticky notes as they leave the classroom.</li>
                            <li>Before the next lesson, collate the &lsquo;bids&rsquo; and list the amount which each company has managed to attract in terms of investment.</li>
