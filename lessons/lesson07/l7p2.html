                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> Today we will be looking at <strong>public limited
                                        companies</strong>. This name can be abbreviated to plc in the UK or Inc. in the
                                    USA. They are also known as AG in Germany and SA in France. In your exams you will
                                    always need to use plc.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Public limited companies are incorporated: just like private limited
                                    companies. As we learned in Lesson 5, this means the company has a separate legal
                                    entity from the owners, who therefore have limited liability. However, unlike
                                    private limited companies, there will be many, many shareholders.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Public limited companies tend to be our biggest companies and the reason
                                    is in their name. They are the only form of company which can sell shares directly
                                    to the public. The reason there are so many owners is that shares are available to
                                    buy on the stock market and, therefore, anyone who thinks the company will make
                                    money can purchase part of the ownership of it.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them<em>: If a company believes it can attract enough people to want to buy shares
                                    in it, it can undertake a <strong>stock market flotation:</strong> also called
                                    &lsquo;<strong>going public&rsquo;</strong>. This means that a private limited
                                    company can agree to create millions of new shares in the company which will be
                                    available for sale to the public from a certain date. </em></li>
                            <li>Explain that, after this date, any shareholder wishing to sell any of their shares in
                                the newly created public limited company can do so easily on the stock market.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>This means that there is a secondary market for the shares in the
                                    company and investors buy and sell many thousands of them every minute of every day.
                                    However, the money those shareholders receive for selling their shares does not get
                                    returned to the company because the shares belonged to the shareholders and so they
                                    get to keep the returns and any financial gains on any resale.</em></li>

                            <li>Give students 1 minute to think of the best answer to the question. They should do this
                                individually.</li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, tell students to share their answers with a partner.</li>
                            <li>After 1 more minute, select a pair to share their answer.</li>
                            <li>Guide the class towards the correct understanding. Tell them: <em>Almost all of the
                                    biggest companies are public limited companies because being able to create large
                                    volumes of shares means that huge amounts of new share capital is created for the
                                    company. Although the original owners may choose to keep much of this money, a
                                    significant amount will also be left inside the company as capital to grow the
                                    business further. </em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>For example, in 2012 Facebook went public and created 421 million
                                    shares, at a price of $38 each. The founders and original shareholders in the
                                    private limited company kept some of the shares for themselves and the billions of
                                    dollars raised by the flotation created finance to allow the company to grow even
                                    bigger so that today it is one of the world&rsquo;s largest companies. </em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2 and read through the bullets as a class.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>although private limited companies also have to publish some
                                    information, the amount and detail required is much larger for a public limited
                                    company. This means it is available for competitors, shareholders, investors and any
                                    other member of the public to see.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Because the financial information provided is so complicated and has to
                                    be in a specific format to allow the public to compare different public limited
                                    companies&rsquo; performances, it must be checked and verified to be true by a
                                    qualified auditor who works for an independent company of accountants.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Unlike private limited companies, where the shareholders are often the
                                    directors too, public limited companies have so many shareholders that this would
                                    never be possible. Instead, shareholders elect directors every year or two by
                                    voting. Those directors are specialist managers and have a legal responsibility to
                                    act in the best interests of the shareholders.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students to make a note of the information in their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3 and ask students to show an answer on mini whiteboards or pieces of
                                paper. They can write &lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;F&rsquo;.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 1</strong> some students will struggle to understand why the
                                &lsquo;re-sale&rsquo; of shares (after an initial stock market flotation) does not
                                provide capital for the company, but instead does for the shareholders themselves. Use
                                the analogy of having baked a cake. It takes some resources to &lsquo;prepare&rsquo; the
                                cake: your time, the cost of ingredients, your secret recipe, the costs of power,
                                renting the kitchen from your parents. If you try a slice of the cake and think it is
                                amazing and other people will also love it you could try and sell further
                                &lsquo;shares&rsquo; in it. You might split it into 11 slices (plus the one you have
                                already eaten.) You decide to sell 7 &lsquo;shares&rsquo; and keep 4 for your family.
                                The 7 people you sell shares (slices) of the cake to now own those shares and have had
                                to give you money for them. That money you receive pays for your initial costs (butter,
                                time etc.) and you will hopefully have quite a lot of spare money which represents your
                                &lsquo;return on investment&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;extra reward&rsquo; you can expect
                                to receive because you were willing to risk the cake being a flop and therefore
                                suffering losses (buying butter etc.) However, after other shareholders bought a slice
                                of the cake, they now own the rights to that slice and so can choose to sell it on
                                themselves: you would not expect them to give you (or the company) the money they
                                receive from doing so &ndash; it is the same with re-selling shares in a plc.</li>
                            <li>In<strong> Student work 1, </strong>some students may find Question 2 and Question 3
                                difficult. Direct them to the top two sections of p. 31 of the <strong>Student
                                    Book</strong>, which provides some support. For Q2, an example sentence could be:
                                <strong>&lsquo;</strong>1a is both because ltds and plcs are both <em>incorporated
                                </em>businesses and so there is a distinction between the legal entity that is the
                                company (which owes the debt) and the shareholder.&rsquo; For Q3, you could also suggest
                                that students think about how many investors they were seeking for their own company in
                                the last lesson (<strong>Lesson 6</strong>) and how much money they asked for.

                            <li>Explain that, in an exam, students may be asked about which form of ownership would be
                                most suitable for a certain company, or whether the owner(s) should change to a
                                different form of ownership. These questions require students to <em>know</em> the
                                features of different types of company, be able to <em>apply</em> those features to the
                                specifics of the company they are told about and then explain why a particular feature
                                would or would not be useful (or risky) for a firm (<em>analysis</em>).</li>

                                    understand the (dis)advantages. </em></li>

                                advantage or a disadvantage of being a <strong>public</strong> limited company.</li>
                            <li>Invite volunteers to identify the advantages. Make a note of any incorrect answers
                                before revealing the correct answers on Slide 6.</li>
                            <li>If any students have answers incorrect, ask for a volunteer to explain why a particular
                                statement is a disadvantage rather than an advantage.</li>
                            <li>Tell students to copy the information on Slide 6 into their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 7 to confirm the disadvantages. Check students&rsquo; understanding,
                                dealing with any misconceptions.</li>
                            <li>Tell students to copy the information on Slide 7 into their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Lead a class discussion, using the following questions.</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Why may plcs have a high profile in the media?</em> (Answer:
                                Because once a business is a public company, its financial results, share prices etc.
                                are available to everyone and so become part of stories that are reported by the press,
                                because their audience may be interested in buying or selling those or other shares.
                                This creates publicity for the company.)</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Why may plcs experience economies of scale?</em> (Answer: Because
                                plcs are large companies they will expect to have lower costs (on average) than smaller
                                companies. One reason might be the bulk-buying discounts they can expect to receive from
                                suppliers.)</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Why may plcs have some degree of market power?</em> (Answer: Large
                                companies that dominate their market (as plcs can do) can become so powerful that they
                                can establish an &lsquo;expected standard&rsquo; for how a service is delivered or for
                                how much it is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to charge for a produce. Other, smaller, companies
                                often have to follow their lead even if they do not want to.)</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Why may the managers of plcs be able to run the company in their
                                    own interests, rather than those of the owners?</em> (Answer: Because plcs have
                                thousands of shareholders, they cannot control day-to-day decision-making in the
                                business. Therefore, they trust directors to do this for them, but those directors may
                                take decisions with a view to protecting their own jobs or achieving financial bonuses
                                or pay rises, rather than increasing the amount of profit the company makes or how much
                                it is worth, which is what the owners want them to do.)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>it is important to remember these advantages and disadvantages as
                                    they will allow you to <strong>justify</strong> decisions you make about what the
                                    best form of ownership is for different companies.</em></li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>A multinational is a large business with significant production or service operations in
                                at least two different countries.</li>
                            <li>Sony is a huge multinational corporation. In 2016, Sony employed over 125 000 people
                                across the world and enjoyed sales of about US$80 000 million. Sony has factories,
                                offices and technology centres in many countries around the world including Japan,
                                China, Europe, the USA and India.</li>
                            <li>One common feature of multinationals is their powerful advertising and marketing
                                capability. This means, for example, they can invest huge amounts of money in impressive
                                advertising campaigns to outcompete smaller rivals. In this case, Sony is a highly
                                recognised global brand name. The strength of the brand has been built up over many
                                years of successful trading. However, to support the brand Sony continue to invest
                                heavily in global advertising. Figure 4.4 shows that Sony invested JPY 474 370 in
                                worldwide advertising in 2014.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Another common feature of multinationals is the huge assets and turnover. This means that
                            multinationals are extremely well resourced and can often afford to take on large-scale
                            contracts and projects that many other firms could not cope with. In this case, in 2016,
                            Sony enjoyed sales revenue of around US$80 000 million. Sony has factories, offices and
                            technology centres in many countries around the world including Japan, China, Europe,
                            America and India. Finally, the value Of Sony's assets at the end of June 2016 was US$159
                            450 million. The scale of these numbers shows how big Sony is as a business.</p>

                                    select a volunteer group to provide an answer and to justify that answer.</em></li>
                            <li>Take one of these situations from <strong>Worksheet 2</strong> at a time:
                                <strong>D</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, <strong>G</strong>, <strong>H</strong>,
                                <strong>L</strong>, and <strong>N</strong>. For each situation, ask a different group to
                                provide an answer and to justify their answer.</li>
                            <li>If there is time, discuss any alternative suggestions from different groups.</li>

                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        
                        <p><strong>H</strong> <strong>Public limited company</strong> because the business is already of a reasonable size (medium-sized) and so is likely to be a ltd at the moment. It wishes to grow quickly and the best way to achieve this will be through investing money into developing new products and promoting these to customers which will mean it needs to increase the number of products it can produce. All of these activities will require large amounts of money and, because the company is already quite successful, the best way to achieve this is likely to be by going public and becoming a plc.</li>
                            <p><strong>F</strong> <strong>Private limited company</strong> because the business has been run by one owner for many years so will currently be either a sole trader or a private limited company. The owner wishes to bring her daughter into the business to share responsibilities and learn about the company so it can no longer be a sole trader. Becoming a partnership is a possibility but the &lsquo;situation&rsquo; stated the owner wanted her daughter to be a shareholder and so this can only occur with a limited company. Private limited company is the only &lsquo;limited&rsquo; option because the company is not big enough to go public.</p>
                            <p><strong>G</strong> <strong>Sole trader</strong> because the two owners feel they cannot work together to manage the company any longer so must dissolve their partnership. Because they both know the industry well and want to continue within it as individuals a sole trader status is likely to suit both of them best as this form of ownership will be easy to establish and reflect their current levels of liability.</p>
                            <p><strong>H</strong> <strong>Private limited company</strong> because the business is described as &lsquo;large, with a powerful shareholder&rsquo; so it must be a limited company to have shareholders. This shareholder wants to gain full control of the business and so will need to buy the remaining shares from their current owners, which would allow them to change the ownership from a public to private limited company (or just to remain a limited company but with fewer owners).</p>
                            <p><strong>M</strong> <strong>Public limited company</strong> is the only option because the business wants to allow 2800 staff to each share a small proportion of the ownership (and therefore the shares) of the company. This means they will need to float the company, creating a lot of new shares so the current owners receive many thousands and the employees can each be given a few to reflect their contributions to the company.</p>
                            <p><strong>N</strong> <strong>Partnership</strong> as there will be two owners a sole trader would not be appropriate. The simplest forms of business to operate are unincorporated companies as they do not require any specific paperwork to be completed so a partnership would be best.</p>

                            <li>Q1 covers a simple knowledge recall of a definition; Q2 requires students to refer to the relevant information earlier in the chapter, ensuring they are practising research and comprehension skills; Q3 covers the above skills but requires students to apply this information and use it in a persuasive manner; Q4 and Q5 cover some knowledge recall or use of a textbook for referencing an earlier passage of text; Q6 is a much more detailed piece of writing which requires students to consider both sides of an argument and to come to a reasoned judgement based on their presentation of arguments for and against.</li>
