                        <h4><strong>Legal structures of sole traders and partnerships </strong>
                        </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Different businesses are set up to have different
                                </em><strong><em>legal structures</em></strong><em>. A legal structure refers to
                                </em><em>how a company </em><em>is owned and who runs it, as well as how the government
                                    treats it. Today&rsquo;s lesson will focus on two distinct forms of legal structure
                                    that share some common features: </em><strong><em>sole traders</em></strong><em> and
                                </em><strong><em>partnerships</em></strong><em>. Any legal structures that govern how a
                                    company functions </em>can <em>also be referred to as &lsquo;forms of
                                    ownership&rsquo;.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Both sole traders and partnerships are
                                </em><strong><em>unincorporated businesses</em></strong><em>. This means </em><em>the
                                    law sees no separation or distinction between the owner (or owners) and the
                                    company</em>.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>This lack of separation between the person and the business means
                                    that if the business owes money that it cannot repay, the owner or owners are
                                    personally responsible for</em><em> its debts. </em></li>
                            <li><em>This means that the owner is liable to repay all of the money that their company
                                    owes</em><em>,</em><em> and so may be forced to sell their own assets, such as a car
                                    or house, to repay the business&rsquo;s debts. However, this would generally only
                                    happen if the business becomes bankrupt. Therefore, this type of company is referred
                                    to as having </em><strong><em>unlimited liability</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
                            <li>If students are unsure about the meanings of &lsquo;liable&rsquo; and
                                &lsquo;assets&rsquo;, remind them that they mean &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; and
                                &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>In contrast, companies with </em><strong><em>limited
                                        liability</em></strong><em> are </em><em>known as <strong>incorporated
                                        businesses</strong>. The owners have a separate legal identity from their
                                    business meaning they &nbsp;are not liable for all of the debts of those companies:
                                    they can only lose the value of the money they have personally invested into the
                                    company rather than their personal possessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></li>
                            <li>Explain to students that businesses with unlimited liability, such as sole traders and
                                partnerships, tend to be much smaller than limited liability (incorporated) businesses
                                and much more simply structured and managed.</li>

                            <li>Ask volunteers to suggest answers before clicking to reveal the correct answers.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>An unincorporated business owned by just one person is known as a
                                </em><strong><em>sole trader</em></strong><em>. If two or more people own an
                                    unincorporated business together, it is known as a
                                </em><strong><em>partnership</em></strong><em>. Most partnerships have a few partners,
                                    but there can be up to 20 partners.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Go through the key features of a sole trader, then tell students to note them down in
                                their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Explain to students that sole traders are a common form of ownership for small
                                businesses &nbsp;such as window cleaners, plumbers and personal trainers.</li>
                            <li>Give students two minutes to discuss with a partner some of the advantages of being a
                                sole trader.</li>
                            <li>Ask a pair to share their advantages with the class and discuss.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3 and tell students to note the advantages listed in their exercise
                                books.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>There is no paperwork involved in setting up a sole trader business,
                                    so it suits small companies and owners who do not have business experience. The
                                    owner also retains full control </em><em>to </em><em>make all of the decisions and
                                    keep all </em><em>the profits.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students two minutes to discuss with a partner some of the disadvantages of being a
                                sole trader.</li>
                            <li>Ask another pair for the disadvantages they have identified and discuss as appropriate.
                            </li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4 and tell students: <em>Because there is just one owner, sole traders
                                    must make all the important decisions themselves and may need to work long hours.
                                    Growing sole trader companies can also be difficult because of a lack of finance
                                    available. Of course, there is also the issue of unlimited liability, and if the
                                    owner dies, the company ceases to exist. </em></li>
                            <li>Tell students to write down the disadvantages listed on Slide 4.</li>

                                check their answers with a partner and discuss any disagreement over word choice so that
                                they have confirmed all answers before they move on to questions 2&ndash;4.</li>
                            <li>Briefly share findings as a class. Ask volunteers to suggest answers and ask for a show

                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 1</strong> some students may struggle with the concept that
                                a sole trader may be the only business owner but that the business can still employ
                                other people. Ask students to consider what would happen if a sole trader had to work
                                alone: never being able to have holidays, afford to be absent through illness etc.
                                Stress that it is just the ownership of a sole trader that rests with just one
                                individual, and many such businesses will have other employees.</li>
                            <li>In&nbsp;<strong>Student work 1</strong>, in Question 1 (a) on&nbsp;<strong>Worksheet
                                    1</strong>, some students may not understand what a &lsquo;separate legal
                                identity&rsquo; means. Explain that companies are only seen to have been formally
                                created (incorporated) when they are registered as a limited company with the government
                                and tax authorities. Therefore, sole traders and partnerships benefit from much quicker
                                and easier set-up than limited (incorporated companies). Therefore, a separate legal
                                identity is when the incorporated business is treated (under law) as a different
                                &lsquo;entity&rsquo; or &lsquo;thing&rsquo; to the owner(s).</li>

                                    sole trader, such as unlimited liability and being unincorporated, more than one
                                    person owns it.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students to remember the disadvantages of being a sole trader that they learned
                                earlier in the lesson (<strong>Teaching session 1 </strong>and <strong>Worksheet
                                    1</strong>, Question 4).</li>
                            <li>Ask them: <em>Do these disadvantages apply to just sole traders, or do some of them also
                                    affect partnerships? If so, which ones?</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to consider their answers. They should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Take feedback. Ask students: <em>Can you name the two disadvantages that would only
                                    apply to a sole trader?</em> (Answers: The owner has to make all the decisions which
                                might be stressful or difficult; the owner will often have to work long hours.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>How could a sole trader get help with important decisions and managing
                                    their workload?</em></li>
                            <li>Share ideas briefly as a class before explaining that some sole traders might seek one
                                or more partners to help them run the business.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>A </em><strong><em>partnership</em></strong><em> is a business with
                                    unlimited liability that is owned by between 2 and 20 people who work together to
                                    manage </em><em>the business, making decisions and sharing the profits (or losses)
                                    between themselves.</em></li>

                            <li>Go through the information on the slide with students, then tell them to copy the
                                information into their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Explain to students that the key feature of unincorporated companies, unlimited
                                liability, is still the case for partnerships but that having additional owners can have
                                several benefits:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Having extra support for managing the business and making decisions</li>
                                    <li>Having more owners allows for tasks to be divided up so they can specialise in
                                        what they are best at</li>
                                    <li>With more owners, there is more scope for raising money. This can be used to
                                        help the business survive when first launched or to grow at a later stage.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: Many companies that provide professional services, where workers need
                                specific qualifications and may have studied for many years, are partnerships. Dentists,
                                lawyers and architects often operate in partnerships.</li>
                            <li>Remind students that it is possible to move from being a sole trader to a partnership
                                (or any other form of company) at any stage of the business&rsquo;s life &ndash; it does
                                not have to be decided when first starting up.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Give students two minutes to identify which disadvantages of being a partnership do not
                                also relate to sole traders. They should work individually, noting the correct answers
                                in their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Take feedback. Ask volunteers to suggest answers and discuss whether each is correct or
                                not.</li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the answers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ask students: Look at the options again. What are the advantages of being in a partnership
                            rather than being a sole trader? (Answer: i)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students: What advantages are common to a partnership and a sole trader? (Answers:
                                d, e)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: Although profits have to be shared in a partnership, it would be expected
                                that overall profits would likely be higher because there are more people involved in
                                the business.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: As both partnerships and sole traders are unincorporated businesses where
                                there is no distinction between the owner and the business itself, if an owner in a
                                partnership dies, that &lsquo;entity&rsquo; or business will also cease to exist &ndash;
                                because an owner has.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: This means that the remaining options of there not being anyone to help
                                with difficult decisions and it being more difficult to raise finance are both
                                disadvantages of being a sole trader compared to a partnership.</li>
                            <li>Explain that having to do what the majority of owners want can be a significant
                                disadvantage if one owner disagrees strongly, especially because the unlimited liability
                                can mean that owner is personally liable for losses arising from a decision they did not
                                agree with or support. This is often a source of disagreement within partnerships and
                                can lead to the partnership being dissolved.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: One way of avoiding issues created by disagreements is to have a deed of
                                partnership. This document is not mandatory but helps by setting out details of how the
                                partners agree to work together and resolve any issues.</li>

                                    find other partners who are willing to join you and share a similar vision for what
                                    sort of company they wish to establish.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students that they will be presenting their ideas to the class (in the

                                information shown on the board. They should keep notes in their exercise books.
                            </li>
                            <li>Give students 10 minutes, working either individually or in a &lsquo;partnership&rsquo;
                                with up to three other partners, to complete the task.</li>
