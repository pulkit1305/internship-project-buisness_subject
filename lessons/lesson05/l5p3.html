                                remainder of the year. The business will also have the objective of
                                having at least 250 different customers registered onto the database by
                                the end of the first year.</li>

                                    <li>I will be in business on my own and am confident running a
                                        business as I have previously operated a hair salon (so I do not
                                        need any partners.)</li>
                                    <li>My business will not run up many debts (paying the majority of
                                        bills upfront). So the risk of having unlimited liability should
                                        not be too high.</li>
                                    <li>I will be able to keep all of the business's profits and do not
                                        need specialist advice from anyone else. This also gives me the
                                        flexibility to hire additional staff when customers have
                                        sufficient interest &nbsp;to merit having more staff.</li>
                                    <li>I do not want to involve another owner in decision-making
                                        because I think it could lead to disagreements and mean that it
                                        takes too long to make decisions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>I understand that the following disadvantages of being a sole trader
                                could affect Top Tips:
                                <ul class-="square">
                                    <li>It may be difficult for me to find enough cash for a deposit on
                                        a salon and to buy the equipment I need because I will not have
                                        any other partners who are willing to put money into the
                                        business. (I plan to use my savings to resolve this issue.)</li>
                                    <li>If the business becomes bankrupt, I will have to repay any debts
                                        the business has myself and could lose my family home. (I do not
                                        think losing my home is likely as once the business is running,
                                        I will not have many costs &ndash; just the rent, which I will
                                        pay in advance out of my personal savings.)</li>
                                    <li>If I wanted to expand into providing another product or service
                                        (such as facial treatments), I do not have any expertise
                                        &nbsp;so this might&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;be difficult
                                        without a partner who knows about that aspect of business.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An example answer (partnership):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our business is called King &amp; Ormsby and will be a small accountancy
                                company.</li>
                            <li>The company will be a partnership with two partners, owned and run by me
                                and a friend, who are both qualified accountants.</li>
                            <li>The main objectives are to grow the business so that we can both earn
                                more personal income than we did when we were employed by large
                                accountancy companies. The business will also have the objective of
                                having at least &pound;200,000 in sales after the first year.</li>
                            <li>King &amp; Ormsby will be a partnership because:
                                <ul class-="square">
                                    <li>The business will not take large amounts of risk &nbsp;and so
                                        does not need to have limited liability. We are also insured
                                        against any losses.</li>
                                    <li>We chose a partnership because we both specialise in different
                                        aspects of accounting and want to appeal to clients who may need
                                        a range of services.</li>
                                    <li>We want to be able to keep all of the profits (shared 50/50)
                                        rather than work for a company that keeps most of the income we
                                        earn to cover its overheads and then makes a large profit based
                                        on our work. We do not feel we need so much administrative
                                        support and could run our company more efficiently.</li>
                                    <li>Having another partner will be useful for us both to have a
                                        trusted and knowledgeable person to discuss difficult business
                                        decisions with.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>I understand that the following disadvantages of being a partnership
                                could affect King &amp; Ormsby:
                                <ul class-="square">
                                    <li>We do not have large levels of personal savings and so will have
                                        to borrow to start the company, and this could be difficult as a
                                        partnership because we do not have much collateral to offer
                                        lenders so may not be able to raise sufficient money to rent
                                        premises, carry out marketing etc.</li>
                                    <li>If the business becomes bankrupt, we will have to repay any
                                        debts the business has, and so could become personally indebted.
                                        This could also affect our ability to borrow in the future and
                                        start other businesses and damage our reputation as good
                                        financial managers or advisers.</li>
                                    <li>Becoming a limited company might persuade some larger clients
                                        that we are a reputable business; however, we plan to work with
                                        smaller organisations and offer them better value for money so
                                        we have chosen to run the lowest cost form of ownership to
                                        support this aim.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>b </strong>A deed of partnership may be helpful because it sets out an agreement between
                        partners so that they all know what has been agreed about how the partnership will function.
                        This can be referred to in the event of disagreements so they can be resolved quickly. The deed
                        will act as a set of &lsquo;rules&rsquo; so that each partner knows what they can expect of the
                        others and what is expected of them.</li>
                    <li>Example answer</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Deed of partnership ‒ Kisuli, Okumu and Owino</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Each partner will contribute KES 2m to provide finance to start the business.</li>
                    <li>Profits and losses will be shared equally between the owners because they all contributed
                        the same amount of money to start it up and will all work full-time in the business.</li>
                    <li>The partnership can be dissolved if any of the three partners requests this in writing,
                        giving three months&rsquo; notice. Should this happen, the partners will seek two
                        independent valuations of the business&rsquo;s assets, and an average valuation will be
                        taken of those two. The partners will each share that value equally once the business has
                        either been sold to another company or the assets sold off to raise money.</li>
                    <li>Each partner will have one vote on important decisions and majority decision-making will be
                        respected.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If &nbsp;all three partners agree to admit a new partner, this will be allowed (although each
                    owner will have a veto if they do not approve the person recommended by any other partner). The
                    value of the business will be agreed (as in point 3 above), and the new partner will be expected
                    to contribute capital equivalent to one-third of that value.</p>
