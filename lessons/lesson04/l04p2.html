                            <li>$624.2m + $56.8m = $681.0m. Explain that it is important to remember both the $ sign and the m for million: but that you do not actually need the ‘.0’ part.</li>
                        <li>$8.6bn can be written as $8,600m: $8,600m – $832m = $7,768m (or $7.768bn). Explain that millions and billions are used quite often in business to reflect large amounts of money and therefore accurately understanding that a billion is 1,000 millions is important.</li>
                        <li>$330.0m – $316.9m = $13.1m. To calculate the percentage increase, divide the difference (the increase) by the original profit figure and multiply by 100 to give \(\frac{13.1}{316.9}\times100=4.13\%\) increase.</li>

                            <li>Ask for a volunteer to explain how to calculate the percentage change in revenue from 2019 to 2020.</li>
                            <li>Use the student’s suggestion to write the formula onto the board:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>\(\frac{(New\;value\;-\;Orginal\;Value)}{Orginal\;Value}\times100\)</li>
                                    <li>Answer:\(\frac{(149-75)}{75}\times100=98.67\%\)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>This is an increase because the value is positive. If the value was negative, this would show a decrease.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students to copy down the formula from the board into their exercise books.
                                </li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to calculate the percentage increase in both <strong>cost of sales</strong> and <strong>gross profit</strong> from 2019 to 2020. Ensure that students know the formula for working out gross profit (sales revenue – cost of sales). Give them 2 minutes to do this, working individually.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to show answers on mini whiteboards (they can use the formula on the board).
                                Click to reveal the answers.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Sometimes you will need to identify relevant information from within a graph, chart or table. It is important to understand the time frame involved in a percentage change calculation</em></li>
                            <li>Give students this example, pointing out the relevant information on the graphic within the slide as you do so: <em>If the company’s sales were increasing by 14% in 2008 and you are asked ‘what was the percentage change in the rate of sales growth between 1995 and 2008’ you would need to use the change over this time (14 – 11, which we are given on the chart) and divide by the original value which was from 1995 – therefore 11. So, 3/11 × 100 = 27.27%.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to calculate the percentage change in the rate of sales growth between 1995 and 2020. They should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to put their answers on their mini whiteboards and then click to reveal the answer.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Because the value fell over the period, we end up with a minus sign and this represents a decrease in the rate of sales growth, although the size of the percentage change is not affected.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>You also need to be able calculate a number as a percentage of another number.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>
                            <li>Explain that the 975,000 SGD figure is the total of the sales of all four companies that make up the market within the town.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>If you are not given a total figure in a question like this, you may have to add the sales of each company up to calculate this value.</em></li>
                            <li>Remind students that in <strong>Lesson 1</strong> they learned that market share was an important financial objective for many companies and so being able to measure it and then calculate whether it changes over time is important as it allows a company to measure how successful they have been in meeting their objective.</li>
                            <li>Explain that a similar formula allows us to calculate market share (or any other number as a percentage of another number).</li>

                            <li>Tell students to copy the formula into their exercise books.</li>

                            <li>Ask a student to talk through how to calculate the market share of Property Climb in 2020. Click to reveal the answer.</li>  
                            <li>Click on Slide 7. </li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to calculate the market share (to one decimal place) of all four companies for 2019.</li>
                            <li>Get students to show answers for each question on a mini whiteboard. Click to reveal the answers. Check any incorrect answers and take students through the correct calculation if necessary. Answers are stated to one decimal place.</li>
                            <li>Students can now practise these calculations further in <strong>Student work 1</strong></li>

                        <li>Give students about 9 minutes to answer the questions. They should spend about 3 minutes on Q1 and about 6 minutes on Q2 and Q3. They should work individually.</li>
                        <li>For Q1, explain that where sales revenue has fallen, that represents a decrease and so the percentage change value will be negative.</li>
                        <li>For Q2 and Q3, explain that they will need to calculate a number as a percentage of another number (as they did in the last part/question of <strong>Teaching session 1</strong>) to calculate gross and <strong>operating profit</strong> margins. Ensure that students have the formula for both margins. Explain that these ‘margins’ are simply a way of business owners using percentages to allow them to see what proportion of their revenues they get to keep as profit. This is an example of how a mathematical calculation is applied to a business context in this subject.</li>

                        <h3>Support</h3>
                        <p>For students who struggle with <strong>Calculating percentages:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In <strong><strong>Teaching session 1</strong></strong>, some students may struggle with the concept of a
                                    percentage (or proportion). Use the example of students within a class: ask students to add up how many students
                                    from one particular tutor group there are in the Business class, add up the total number of all students in the
                                    class. Show that by dividing the number of tutor group members by the total number of students we are working
                                    out the proportion of students who fit into a specific category (and that we simply multiply the result by 100
                                    to turn it into a percentage).</li>
                                <li>In <strong><strong>Student work 1</strong></strong>, some students may need support with identifying which
                                    numbers to &lsquo;plug in&rsquo; to their percentage change formula in Q1. Use the initial example from Slide 1
                                    of the slideshow in <strong><strong>Teaching session 1</strong></strong> relating to revenue to exemplify that
                                    the &lsquo;change&rsquo; is simply the difference between the &lsquo;New&rsquo; and &lsquo;Old&rsquo; values so
                                    is one minus the other and the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; will always be the value <em><em>before</em></em>&nbsp;the
                                    change. Use the example from Slide 2 of the slideshow in <strong><strong>Teaching session
                                            1</strong></strong>&nbsp;relating to &lsquo;cost of sales&rsquo; to walk students through identifying
                                    the &lsquo;Change&rsquo; and Original.</li>
                                <li>In <strong><strong>Student work 1</strong></strong>, some students may struggle to start Q2 and Q3. Take them
                                    through the calculation of gross profit as this is likely to be what causes them a problem. Explain that the
                                    gross profit margin is the percentage of the sales revenue that the company keeps as gross profit and get them
                                    to calculate this. Then tell them that operating profit margin is 57.8% and get them to use the same methodology
                                    to calculate the operating profit value (Answer: &pound;693,600) to see whether they have grasped the process.
                                    They can then check the &pound;693,000 answer by subtracting <strong><strong>expenses </strong></strong>(given
                                    in <strong><strong>Worksheet 1</strong></strong>) from the gross profit figure.</li>

                        <li>Tell students: <em>Calculating averages is useful for businesses in many contexts. Averages are used to measure how well businesses perform in a number of different ways, such as how much (on average) it costs them to produce each product, how many customers (on average) each staff member serves in a day or how much revenue or profit they earn (on average) from each product sold.</em></li>

                        <li>Ask students: <em>How would you calculate the average shoe size of this group of students?</em> (Answer: By adding up the different values (shoe sizes of the group) and then dividing by the number of group members)</li>
                        <li>Perform the calculation on the board:</li>

                            <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>To calculate labour productivity, we take the total level of output (number of products/units made) and divide that by the number of workers it took to produce that volume of goods</em>.</li>
                            <li>Tell students to copy the formula from Slide 3 into their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>

                            <li>In <strong><strong>Teaching session 2</strong></strong> when calculating average costs on Slide
                                1<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>of the slideshow, some students may struggle with the initial question
                                about how to calculate cost/unit. Explain that there are three different types of cost to be totalled for each
                                company. That figure represents total cost and so an average can be found by simply dividing by the number of
                                products (units) made. Students do not actually need to use the (000,000) info. As long as they are ignoring it
                                for all of the values, their final answer will still be correct.</li>

                                be reluctant to begin calculations. Show Slide 2 of the slideshow from <strong><strong>Teaching session
                                        2</strong></strong> and suggest that they revisit the example from <strong><strong>Teaching session 2
                                    </strong></strong>as <strong><strong>Worksheet 2</strong></strong>&nbsp;follows exactly the same
                                methodology. Alternatively, they could be shown how to do the initial calculation by a student who you know is
                                capable of coaching them to do the initial calculation and then ask them to continue with subsequent examples.

                                &lsquo;the point where the company achieves maximum productivity&rsquo; in Question 4. Explain that productivity
                                will be at its maximum when the cost of producing each product is being minimised (i.e. is at its lowest point)
                                so you need to find the level of output associated with the lowest average (unit) cost.</li>

                                (profit as a percentage of revenue) is something that students have done in maths for quite some time and is a
                                vital way of businesses working out how successful they have been so it relates to assessing whether they have
