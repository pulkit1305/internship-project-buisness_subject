                                            amounts of money if it had fewer or smaller offices. This was because it
                                            could allow the majority of its staff to do their jobs from home. Therefore,
                                            expensive offices that had been created in London to attract high-skilled
                                            workers living around the city could be closed or be much smaller. </em>

                                    <li><em>Also, the Head Office did not need to be located in one place any longer,
                                            because better video conferencing and other online communications
                                            technologies allowed staff to meet virtually rather than having to be in one
                                            large expensive office. </em></li>
                                    <li><em>Being able to offer home-working meant that the company could recruit the
                                            best staff wherever they lived. Customers had never really visited Deloitte
                                            offices, with staff visiting their clients instead and so the &lsquo;close
                                            to market&rsquo; influence was not really relevant to where Deloitte chose

                            <li>Lead a brief discussion, guiding students towards the answer: It is likely that the
                                degree to which the internet influences businesses will increase as we move from the
                                primary to the tertiary sector. Therefore, the sticky notes are likely to be in a sweep
                                from bottom-left to top-right.</li>
                            <li>Take a photo of the board with the sticky notes in case you want to refer back to it.

                                business. For example:

                            <li>Tell students: <strong><em>Infrastructure </em></strong><em>can refer to any systems
                                    that connect businesses and or people together, such as bridges, broadband links or
                                    roads.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain: <em>Governments are keen to attract businesses who bring jobs, investment,
                                    skills, tax revenue and possibly new infrastructure to an area. </em></li>
                            <li>Go through the list of methods on the slide as a class and tell students to make a note
                                of the key information. Mention that key infrastructure will include building roads,
                                schools and 5G networks. Key activities may include providing payments to businesses for
                                doing certain things e.g. investing in modern machinery or research, hiring unemployed
                                workers.</li>
                            <li>Next, tell students:

                                    <li><em>A <strong>trade bloc</strong> is an association between nations who think
                                            that it will be beneficial for them to reduce the barriers to businesses and
                                            consumers trading goods and services between those member countries. The
                                            countries are often in the same area of the world.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Some of the ways trade blocs make doing business between members easier
                                            include reducing or removing <strong>tariffs</strong>, which are taxes on
                                            imported goods, reducing the level of paperwork or checks before moving
                                            goods between countries, allowing workers to work in any country, and
                                            bringing areas such as tax, labour laws etc. closer to a common standard.
                                            They may also align product standards. For example, all EU countries will

                            <li>Tell students: <em>The impacts are the benefits the features are intended to create.
                                    These benefits are incentives for businesses to relocate.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to complete the matching activity individually. Tell students:
                                <em>Some impacts may result from more than one &lsquo;feature&rsquo;. If this is the
                                    case, prioritise the most important feature that creates that impact.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students to hold up the answer to &lsquo;A. Reduced tariffs&rsquo; on a mini
                                whiteboard or a piece of paper (they can just write the number of the relevant impact).
                            </li>
                            <li>Confirm the answer is impact 4.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>SAFTA is a trade bloc in South Asia where India, Pakistan and other
                                    countries in the area agreed to an initial 30% cut in tariffs on the movement of
                                    goods between countries with the objective of eventually removing all tariffs.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Repeat for remaining features, confirming answers and providing examples.</li>
                            <li>Feature B, Impact 1. Tell students: <em>Border checks take a long time and reduce the
                                    attractiveness of international trade. For example, the CEMAC trade bloc in central
                                    Africa retains quite a lot of barriers and checks. This means 9 forms need to be
                                    filled out for cross-border trade, taking an average of 35.2 days to organise an
                                    export. The average among developed nations is 4.4 forms and 10.9 days. This shows
                                    why the reduction of trade barriers can provide an incentive to businesses to locate
                                    in a particular country because they will be able to trade internationally much more
                                    quickly, cheaply and easily.</em></li>
                            <li>Feature C, Impact 5. Tell students:<em> All businesses supplying goods in the EU use the
                                    same electrical voltages and so goods sold in any country will work in any of the
                                    other 26 members, whereas an expensive transformer would be required to use a TV
                                    sold in the USA. If a producer of TV sets wants to sell to Europe, they may choose
                                    to locate in the EU rather than in the USA because they can sell the same good to
                                    500 million consumers and so benefit from economies of scale.</em></li>
                            <li>Feature D, Impact 3. Tell students:<em> Rules on managing a business will be uniform
                                    within a trade bloc. This will encourage businesses that want to expand out of a
                                    &lsquo;home&rsquo; country to do so into another member of the bloc because the
                                    business will be able to operate in a way it is more comfortable with (compared to a
                                    non-member of the bloc where rules and laws may be very different).</em></li>
                            <li>Feature E, Impact 2. Tell students:<em> Businesses can easily transfer workers between
                                    countries because the working conditions, contracts and worker protections are
                                    similar in other members of a trading bloc. Workers may also be able to move to
                                    countries within the bloc without any restriction.</em></li>

                            <li>Summarise by telling students: <em>Membership of trade blocs provides a range of
                                    benefits to businesses. Remember that how easy it is to do business in a particular
                                    country is a key factor when businesses are deciding where to locate a new (part of
                                    their) business. Similarly, any factors which reduce the cost of doing business will
                                    also attract those businesses to locate within a trade bloc.</em></li>

                                struggle to think of how governments might offer incentives to businesses to (re)locate.

                        <p>An example, using the fictional &lsquo;Top Tips&rsquo; nail and manicure salon:</p>
                        <p>As a relatively small nail and manicure treatment salon, I do not have the option to move to
                            a different country, but I could decide not to operate from a physical &lsquo;salon&rsquo;
                            if it would be more beneficial to allow customers to visit a salon in a room in my house or
                            to go to customers&rsquo; homes or workplaces.</p>
                        
                        <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            <li>The government is considering a new law that means all tattoo and piercing salons have
                                to have a special licence. If they extend this to beauty salons we would have to
                                undertake training and pay for the licence application.</li>
                            <li>My local council may offer us reduced rates (the tax paid to local government based on a
                                building&rsquo;s value) because there are a number of empty shops in the area and they
                                will want to keep a lot of customers coming to the area to encourage businesses. If they
                                cannot give me financial support it strengthens the argument to &lsquo;go mobile&rsquo;.
                                The government is offering a subsidy to reduce the costs of heating commercial buildings
                                over the winter and so this increases the attractiveness of keeping a physical location.
                            </li>
                            <li>The rent on my 41 m<sup>2</sup> shop is &pound;13,000/year, but if I paid about
                                &pound;10,000 I could convert a room in my house and never have to pay rent again.
                                Similarly, I could use my car to travel to customers&rsquo; houses which would also cost
                                nothing other than cost of petrol.</li>
                            <li>As the UK has left the EU trade bloc, I may struggle to attract the staff I would need
                                to help me expand. This is because unemployment here is quite low and previously I could
                                recruit staff from any country in the EU. However, if I can show I cannot find any
                                British staff qualified to work for me, I might be able to bring in a trained technician
                                from outside the EU (where many of those workers are currently located) and I would not
                                have been able to when the UK was part of the EU.</li>
                            <li>On balance I think there are sufficient advantages of retaining a physical high street
                                location to attract customers. Therefore, the government&rsquo;s actions will not
                                convince me to move in the way that some companies might do. However, given that most
                                impacts of government action have a negative impact on my physical business, it might
                                make me more likely to experiment with also offering my services on a mobile basis,
                                rather than from a fixed location.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to come up with an answer. They should work individually. Tell
                                them: <em>Be prepared to justify your choice with</em> <em>a reason to support your
                                    overall decision and think about the arguments for the alternatives.</em></li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, tell students to share their answer with a partner. Remind them they
                                need to justify their choice. They should discuss any differences of opinion.</li>
                            <li>Tell students to show their answers on a mini whiteboard. These should be the answers
                                they identified originally, before sharing with their partner.</li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the answer.</li>
                            <li>Ask students who have answered B or C to justify their choices. Stress that this is a
                                subjective decision designed to allow room for debate and that students would not have
                                an ambiguous multiple-choice question such as this in an exam:
                                <ul span class="square" style="margin-left: 3%;">
                                    <li>Possible reasons for B include the scale of finance that a government can make
                                        available to businesses and the fact that a financial incentive is easier for
                                        businesses to quantify than other non-financial influences.</li>
                                    <li>Reasons for C might depend on whether a business is currently in a crowded
                                        location, has room to expand where they are, if they wish/need to expand.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>location (or relocation) decisions require businesses to consider
                                    many different factors and so will not be simple (in the way this question was not).
                                </em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2 and give students 1 minute to answer Question 2 individually. Make sure
                                that students understand that unilaterally means &lsquo;actions taken by (or affecting)
                                just one group, without the agreement of others&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to show their answers on a mini whiteboard.</li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the answer.</li>

                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Why is A not a correct answer?</em> (Answer: because individual
                                governments within a trade bloc cannot independently make decisions about the level of
                                tariff the members must <strong>all</strong> charge)</li>

                            <li>Likely answer: Close to a source of raw materials (iii) because it relies on there being
                                ample supplies of coal and does not want to have to transport heavy materials.</li>

                                        labour (iv) so it can maintain its price competitiveness.</li>
                                    <li>The riverboat touring business (C) may choose to be close to competitors (ii) as
                                        they know that customers will be attracted to a certain location and so it will
                                        be important for them to be there to access as many potential customers as

                            <li>Possible answers: job creation, creation of other forms of tax revenue (employment
                                related), better access to Apple products for consumers from the business locating in
                                Ireland, attracting other tech businesses to the country, developing a key skill-set
                                among workers</li>

                            <li>Next, turn to part (b). Ask another volunteer for arguments for removing the tax break.
                                Ask further students for further reasons.</li>
                            <li>Possible answers: It would be difficult for Apple to move if taxes rise in the future,
                                it costs Ireland too much, many of the benefits have already accrued and will remain,
                                Apple is sufficiently profitable to afford higher taxes.</li>
                            <li>Finally, ask students to vote on whether they think countries should provide such a huge
                                tax break.</li>
