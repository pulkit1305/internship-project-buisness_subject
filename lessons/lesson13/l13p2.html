                            <li>Ask students the following questions. They could either call out their answers or write them on mini whiteboards or pieces of paper.
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>What types of enterprise do you think are represented in these images?</em><br>(Answer: A = banana farmer; B = caf&eacute;/coffee shop; C = car plant; D = accountancy company. For D, students may provide a range of office-related enterprises such as law company, estate agent, and so on.)</li>
                                    <li><em>Can you remember the names of the three different sectors of the economy?</em>
                                        <br>(Answer: primary, secondary, tertiary)</li>
                                    <li><em>Can you identify the sectors of the economy pictured in these images?</em>
                                        <br>(Answer: A = primary; B = tertiary; C = secondary; D = tertiary)</li>
                                    <li>Remind students: <em>In addition to retailing shown in image B, the <strong>tertiary sector</strong> includes all forms of services and so in most modern, developed economies is the largest of the three sectors.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Which <strong>primary sector</strong> activity is linked to the business shown in image B</em>?
                                    <br>(Answer: agriculture/farming, for example of coffee, sugar, dairy cows)</li>
                                    <li><em>Which <strong>secondary sector</strong> activity is linked to the business shown in image B?</em>
                                    <br>(Answer: processing – of raw materials, such as flour or sugar into a doughnut)</li>
                                    <li><em>Can you explain the chain of production which links the banana farmer to the tertiary sector? </em>(Possible answer: The bananas are grown in the primary sector, could be processed into a smoothie by manufacturers in the secondary sector and then sold to consumers by a supermarket in the tertiary sector.)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Display a map of the main street of the town closest to the school which shows the names of different businesses. You could use Google Maps or similar. A street view of the local main street would be best. Then follow the steps below.</li>
                            <li>If you cannot get a map of your main street, use the example map <strong>Image: Marlborough</strong> given, which shows the main businesses and landmarks in the town of Marlborough in the UK.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Link
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students<em>: Which sector of the economy do most of these businesses operate in?</em> <em>Can you explain why?</em> (Answer: tertiary, because there are lots of shops and restaurants on the High Street)</li>
                            <li>Choose a specific business shown on the map, for example Rick Stein’s restaurant. Ask students: <em>Can you think of three reasons why this business has chosen to locate where it has?</em></li>
                            <li>Share ideas as a class, guiding students towards valid reasons.</li>
                            <li>Possible answers: Rick Stein’s restaurant is located close to a busy high street that many shoppers walk down so that as many people notice it as possible, near to the Hyde Lane car park so that customers can easily access it, and in an area with many other restaurants because that will draw customers to visit the area. For other businesses, answers could include: proximity to transport links/buses, easy for customers to access, busy location, easy for staff to get to, close to other businesses.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>The factors that affect business location also affect business relocation, which is simply when an existing business moves from its current location to a new one. For example, a growing supermarket may decide to relocate from a high street location to a larger site on the edge of town with car parking so that customers can buy bigger volumes of shopping in one visit.</em></li>
                            <li>Next, display Slide 1 of the slideshow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Link
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain to students that ‘proximity’ means closeness and that ‘<strong>market</strong>’ can be thought of as the place where goods are bought and sold.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to suggest locations for each of the businesses and to explain their reasons. (Possible answers: The sandwich shop should be on the high street to catch passing trade or near to offices to provide meals for workers; hairdresser on a busy street in a residential area that customers can walk to, or have access to parking or local buses; gardener, in an area where houses have large gardens; producer of car windscreens, close to car manufacturers/factories)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>The sector of the economy, and therefore the type of customer the business sells to, will influence where they base themselves.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain: <em>the sandwich shop, hairdresser and gardener are all in the tertiary sector and sell to many different consumers so will want to locate close to large numbers of potential customers. However, the producer of car windscreens, who is in the secondary sector, will sell their products to a smaller range of business customers that they will offer delivery to, unlike the hairdresser or gardener. As a result, the producer of car windscreens may choose their location based on where one or two big customers, such as Toyota or Ford, are located.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Walk students through the bullet points summarising proximity to market by suggesting this means different things to different businesses, depending on what type of market they sell to. Use examples of businesses for each bullet point to illustrate to students, such as: close to where end consumer lives – coffee shop; close to where business customers are located – producer of car windscreens close to a Toyota factory; close to transport links/parking – dentist; close to similar businesses – clothes shops in a large shopping centre; to catch passing trade – hot dog stand.</li>
                            <li>Students could be asked to provide their own examples once you have given an initial example.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:<strong>Some businesses sell to other businesses, which is known as ‘business-to-business’ or 'B2B'. These businesses may be called ‘business customers’ to differentiate them from ‘consumers’, who are the final users of a product. Businesses selling directly to consumers are sometimes referred to as selling ‘B2C’ or ‘business to consumer’.</strong></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                            <li>Explain to students that<strong>labour</strong> is another key influence on where businesses locate.</li>
                            <li>Ask them:<em>Which factors relating to their labour force might influence a business’s location decisions?</em>(Possible answers: wage rates; how many potential workers there are; which skills the business needs; what transport links are available for workers)</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes, working individually, to note down their answers in their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Share findings as a class before revealing the answers on Slide 5.</li>
                            <li>With Slide 5 still displayed, ask students <em>: Can you name any well-known locations of the business activities listed on the slide? (Possible answers, though local examples would be preferable: laboratory developing new medical treatments, Bangalore in India; factories producing food products, Yangzhou in China; computer game design company, Saigon Silicon City in Vietnam; film production company, Hollywood in the USA)</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Different businesses have different requirements for labour and this influences their location decisions. For example, banks which need highly skilled, specialist labour are usually located in city-centre financial districts with good transport links, while Tesla has built its factory in Shanghai where there is relatively cheap labour with experience of car manufacturing.</em></li>
                            <li>If necessary, you could show the <em>Key definitions </em>subject vocabulary and general vocabulary again to help consolidate the new vocabulary for students.</li>

                            <li>Direct students to p. 58 in the <strong>Student Book</strong> and display the questions on Slide 1. Give students 1 minute to read the case study on Renault.</li>

                            <li>Explain that there is no single ‘correct’ answer to <strong>Question 1</strong> and that the reasons for students’ choices are the important point, so students should think carefully when ranking the factors.</li>

                        <h4><strong>Answers</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>1</strong> &amp; <strong>2  </strong>There is no single &lsquo;correct&rsquo; answer for <strong>Question 1</strong> but answers could be: 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 1. The justification is more important than the precise ordering.</p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">A potential rationale could be: Cars are big and heavy so it is cheapest to transport by sea so being close to a port (2) is vital. Morocco&rsquo;s economy is growing quickly so residents will be able to afford cars that are not exported (3), but being at the crossroads of sea links (5) is crucial as most cars are exported. Renault is taking advantage of the infrastructure such as roads and its own rail link (4) to reduce costs of transport. Renault, as a French company, will find it easiest to communicate with workers and local suppliers in the French language (6). Political stability (1) is important to producers but of less importance than the other factors which Renault can control more directly when making location decisions.</p>
                        <p><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The degree of experience or skills in car manufacturing that workers in Tangier have or how much it would cost to train them.</li>
                            <li>What the levels of wages are for workers in Tangier and how this compares to other locations.</li>
                            <li>How many potential workers live in the area and whether they could travel to the factory each day for work.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1</strong>, some students may struggle to link the six factors in the Renault case study to location decisions. Suggest that they focus on the issue of proximity to market (i.e. how close the business is to its likely customers).</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1</strong>, some students may have trouble formulating full sentences to link labour supply to Renault&rsquo;s location decision. Suggest they simply list some issues relating to workers that Renault may face in Tangier.</li>

                            <li>Tell students that being close to the <strong>materials </strong>(such as wind) that they need to produce their goods is an important factor for businesses when deciding on their location.</li>
                            <li>Give students 3 minutes to decide where, in the stylised town, they would locate the following (write the businesses on the board): a paper factory, a food processing factory, a river tours business. Tell them to make sure they have a reason for their choices. Students should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Discuss students&rsquo; ideas as a class. Encourage them to justify their choices before guiding them to these answers: paper factory, top-left (or top-right) close to the trees; food processing factory, centre top close to the farm; river-tours business, bottom centre of the map, close to the lake and the jetty/piers.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Proximity to resources is especially important for businesses that use heavy or bulky materials such as the paper factory, oil refineries, steel makers, power stations and brick-makers. Similarly, being close to power sources is also important for businesses that use lots of energy. For example, some tech companies place servers which need lots of power in Iceland, where hydro-electric and geo-thermal power is plentiful, or in the USA, where fracking has produced cheap power.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What links some of the businesses in the centre of the map/image? </em>(Possible answer: businesses in the entertainment/leisure sector)</li>
                            <li>Ask them: <em>Why do you think businesses in the leisure sector might choose to locate close to one another?</em> (Possible answers: to attract customers visiting their competitors and to catch excess demand from them; to benefit from the reputation of an area as an entertainment centre and so reduce the need to advertise themselves)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you name some other examples of businesses locating in a specific area where there is lots of competition? </em>(Possible answers: restaurants on a busy high street; shops in a retail mall or park; theatres in theatre districts, such as Broadway; banks and insurance companies in a financial district)</li>

                            <li>Walk students through the bullet points that summarise the importance of proximity to materials. In particular, draw students&rsquo; attention to the new terms &lsquo;<strong>brownfield sites</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>greenfield sites</strong>&rsquo;. Give an example of an electricity generating station, which may be built close to a coal mine to minimise the cost of transporting its main raw material (coal).</li>

                        <p>Answers will vary. If students chose a fast food restaurant, possible answers could include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Close customers/market &ndash; 10/10 &ndash; Convenience will be key for customers of a fast food restaurant as they may purchase on impulse if passing a restaurant and will not want to travel far in any case.</li>
                            <li>Close to labour &ndash; 6/10 &ndash; The restaurant may not require many staff but will need to be accessible to workers who may not be highly paid so may not be able to travel far. Being close to customers is probably more important and this is likely to mean that the store will automatically be close to some potential workers.</li>
                            <li>Close to materials &ndash; 2/10 &ndash; The supplies are not too heavy and come from a range of different suppliers so it may not be possible to be close to all of them. Many might be delivered to the company so ease of parking may be more important than being close to a supplier.</li>
                            <li>Far away from competitors &ndash; 2 or 8/10 &ndash; Many fast food restaurants tend to be grouped together as they all want to be close to market and so they may actually want to be close to other fast food companies, but often not ones selling exactly the same type of food. For example, a noodle bar may be located on the same high street as a pizzeria, burger restaurant and a chicken store because it wants to be giving choice to customers but not compete directly with another noodle bar.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Service providers may have different location requirements to those of manufacturers. In this case, Abdullah is choosing a location for his seafood restaurant in Manama, Bahrain. For many service providers, proximity to their market is crucial. This is because many services are sold direct to consumers. For example, restaurants, cafes, shops, hair salons, taxis and dry cleaners have to be located in towns and cities. This is where customers live and shop. In this case Abdullah wants to target business customers working in the financial quarter of the city so this would presumably influence his search for a location.<br />For customers, suppliers and employees, easy access and parking is becoming a serious issue. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in many parts of the world. Businesses need to choose locations where there is less chance of traffic congestion. It is particularly important for customers since they will quickly look for alternatives if they cannot park conveniently. Some service businesses, particularly fast-food providers, are developing &lsquo;drive-through&rsquo; facilities to avoid parking problems. In this case, Abdullah&rsquo;s potential customers, office workers for example, may be within walking distance from his restaurant. This would be an advantage but he might also be keen to find a location where customers can park easily when arriving for a meal or a night out.</li>
                            <li>Abdullah is currently considering a location close to where a number of other restaurants operate. Premises occupied by a recently failed restaurant have become available but he is concerned about the competition in the area &ndash; many entrepreneurs would share this fear. However, in contrast some businesses deliberately choose locations where there is a concentration of similar businesses. This might be important in industries where comparison shopping is popular. It might also be possible to catch the excess demand from existing businesses, particularly if premises are located in a restaurant and entertainment area. Consequently, for these reasons, Abdullah may eventually decide to locate is seafood restaurant close to potential rivals.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For students who struggle with <strong>Factors affecting business location: materials and competitors:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 2</strong>, when looking at Slide 4 of the slideshow <strong>Slideshow: Materials, competitors and location</strong> (the benefits/drawbacks table), some students may struggle to identify disadvantages of proximity to competitors. Suggest they try to think of disadvantages that relate to the advantages they have identified. (The benefits and drawbacks can often be seen as &lsquo;pairs&rsquo;.) You could also suggest students think of a specific business in their local town that they might be familiar with and assess the pros/cons of that business&rsquo; location in terms of proximity to competitors.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2 </strong>(Question 1 of<strong> Task 2</strong>), some students may struggle to identify factors influencing location choice. To support them, ask them to complete <strong>Section 1</strong> of <strong>Worksheet 1</strong>.</li>

                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>Answers will depend on the location used. However, the decision about where to locate each business should be fully justified and justifications should reference the relevant influencing factors. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A tinned food factory may locate on the outskirts of town so that it can have good access to deliveries of materials and will also be close enough for workers from the houses to get to, possibly having enough space to have its own car park for staff.</li>
                            <li>The cinema will focus on being close to market so having a location where lots of people can easily access it: either on the high street close to bus routes or perhaps in an out-of-town shopping centre with lots of parking for customers or a rail link.</li>
                            <li>The museum may want to locate close to other tourist attractions to catch the eye of passing visitors and so be quite central, where locals interested in it may also find it simple to get to.</li>
                            <li>The mushroom farm may locate in the countryside where land is cheaper as there may not be a requirement for many workers to be employed. It is likely to be in an area with lots of other farms although they probably are not competing directly by producing mushrooms.</li>
                            <li>The game design company will want to be close to highly specialised and skilled labour and so may focus on being close to a university that offers game design courses or close to other similar businesses as those skilled staff may have moved to the area looking for work.</li>

                            <li>In this activity, students follow up work they did in <strong>Lesson 9</strong>, where they planned the colonisation of another planet: Terra 2. Here, they plan the main layout/areas of the capital town.</li>
                            <li>As you assign the Homework task, it may be useful to remind students of the scenario: they have travelled to an uninhabited Earth-style planet called Terra 2, in a nearby solar system. There is infrastructure already on the planet. There is no plan for these students to return to Earth any time soon as they were specially selected for this mission. There are 2,000 adults and 400 children on board. Half of the people on board are public sector workers, nurses, doctors, and so on, and the other half are entrepreneurs who ran successful businesses on Earth.</li>
                            <li>This is an opportunity for students to exercise their creativity but make sure they understand that they are undertaking a commercial project which will need business rationale for their location decisions.</li>
                            <li>This activity covers the main factors influencing business location decisions and relocation (the first two of the four elements of specification 1.4.1), so students would be expected to refer to as many of the factors covered in today&rsquo;s lesson as they can &ndash; these include proximity to market, materials, labour and competitors as well as the nature of the business.</li>
                            <li>This is not an activity that you will be able to assign a mark or grade to easily and so you may wish to stress, when assigning the homework activity, that you are looking for creative responses which utilise the information they have been given about Terra 2 as well as the content that students have learned during the lesson.</li>

                                    <li>The rubber for the tyres requires rubber trees to be &lsquo;tapped&rsquo; in the primary sector, that rubber to be vulcanised so that it is turned into a useable tyre in the secondary sector and then further processed in the secondary sector when being assembled into a finished bicycle</li>
                                    <li>The raw material for the saddle is created in the primary sector when animals are farmed for their hides and that material is then processed in the secondary sector where rawhide is tanned and turned into leather. That leather is then further processed in the secondary sector where it is combined with more metal and shaped into a saddle.</li>
