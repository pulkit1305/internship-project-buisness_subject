                            <li>Some students may get confused about the meaning of &lsquo;sales&rsquo; within a business context. Explain that &lsquo;sales&rsquo; may also be used quite generally to talk about the volume of goods that are being sold. For example, &lsquo;we want to increase our sales next year&rsquo; might just mean &lsquo;we are going to sell more products next year than we did this year&rsquo;. Slide 4 of the slideshow (&lsquo;Financial objectives of businesses&rsquo;) in Teaching session 1 is a good opportunity to illustrate the difference between (sales) quantity or volume and (sales) revenue.</li>
                            <li>You could explain that it is always best, where possible, to use precise language in any academic subject and so it is advisable to use &lsquo;sales revenue&rsquo; when talking about a certain value of sales. For example, &lsquo;Apple sold goods worth $366 bn in 2021&rsquo; &ndash; it would be more precise to say, &lsquo;Apple had a sales (or total) revenue of $366 bn in 2021&rsquo;. This could be shortened to &lsquo;Apple had sales of $366bn in 2021&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Students may confuse profit and sales (revenue), forgetting that costs must be paid out of revenue before it can become profit. Take them through the definition of sales revenue and profit so they understand how they can be calculated (TR = SP &times; Q and Profit = TR &ndash; TC). Point out that calculating profit involves revenue so there is clear distinction between the two. Profit will always be less than the value of revenue. Encourage students to think of a very simple business that they are familiar with and to focus on that business&rsquo;s costs, revenues and profits so that they can &lsquo;anchor&rsquo; those concepts around a business they know well.&nbsp;</li>
