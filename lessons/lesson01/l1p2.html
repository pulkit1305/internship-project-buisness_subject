                            <li>Explain: <em>Existing businesses need to have clear objectives so that they know what
                                    they are trying to achieve and can measure how successful they are in achieving

                            <li>Tell students: <em>A business is likely to have five main financial objectives. Copy the
                                    terms from the board into your exercise books.</em></li>
                            <li>Provide an overview of each type of financial objective, focusing, for example, on
                                meaning &ndash; which type of company a specific objective may be most appropriate for
                                and why that objective may be relevant. Ask students to make notes:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><strong>Survival</strong> &ndash; explain: <em>This is about earning enough
                                            money to be able to cover all of the upcoming costs that need to be paid.
                                            This financial objective applies to almost all new businesses. Some
                                            businesses will also focus on survival when there are economic issues in a
                                            country and so customers have less money to spend. All businesses have to
                                            achieve this objective even if they do not explicitly set it as an
                                            objective. </em></li>
                                    <li><strong>Profit</strong> &ndash; explain: <em>Most business owners aim to have
                                            money left over after they have paid all of their costs and this can be
                                            thought of as &lsquo;profit&rsquo;. Profits can be spent in many different
                                            ways including providing a living for the owner(s). The amount of profit
                                            targeted will depend on many factors including size, what the company does
                                            and the general state of the economy. However, setting a numerical target is
                                            important for measuring the success of a business.</em></li>
                                    <li><strong>Sales</strong> &ndash; first explain: <em>Before we talk about sales, it
                                            is important to know that &lsquo;<strong>revenue</strong>&rsquo; is the
                                            money from the sale of goods and services. <br /> </em>Now explain:<em>
                                            Focusing on how many products a company can sell in a specific period of
                                            time or how much revenue a business earns can be more important than how
                                            much profit is being made. This is because businesses often want to grow and
                                            so &lsquo;sales&rsquo; is often seen as an objective to show whether growth
                                            has been achieved, or how much growth has been achieved. Sales can be
                                            measured either through how many products are sold (which is known as
                                            <strong>sales volume</strong>) or by the total amount of money the company
                                            earned from selling its products (which is known as <strong>sales
                                                value</strong> or total revenue).</em></li>
                                    <li><strong>Market share</strong> &ndash; explain: <em>Setting a target number for
                                            how many &lsquo;sales&rsquo; a business will make is important but for
                                            larger companies, they often want to be seen as number one in their market.
                                            So, measuring their sales as a proportion of the total market sales &ndash;
                                            the market share &ndash; allows them to calculate this.</em> <em>Companies
                                            that aren&rsquo;t market leaders may also want to measure market share to
                                            see how they are doing relative to their competitors.</em></li>
                                    <li><strong>Financial security</strong> &ndash; explain: <em>Companies need to
                                            achieve financial security to provide a &lsquo;buffer&rsquo; or cushion so
                                            that they could survive future periods using any spare money from the
                                            current period. Owners also want to be financially secure so that they have
                                            sufficient money (after paying their basic costs of living such as housing
                                            costs or food bills) to maintain their lifestyle and afford luxuries such as
                                            a car or meals out.</em></li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Profit is a crucial concept to understand. It can be calculated as
                                    the difference between a company&rsquo;s total revenue, which is the full value of
                                    the goods that it sells in a certain period of time, and its total cost, which is
                                    all the money spent in order to keep a company running. Tell students to make a note
                                    of the formulae for <strong>total revenue</strong> and <strong>profit</strong>.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Illustrate that total revenue can be calculated by SP &times; Q using the following
                                example of a cake sale in school. You could demonstrate the calculation on the board for
                                students as you work through the example together.</li>
                            <li>Ask students<em>: If you bake 20 cookies and sell them for 50p each, how much revenue do
                                    you get?</em> (Answer: &pound;10)</li>
                            <li>Write the calculation on the board: &pound;0.50 &times; 20 = &pound;10.00</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What about if you had costs of &pound;3 to buy the ingredients &ndash;
                                    how much profit would you make?</em> (Answer: &pound;7)</li>
                            <li>Write the calculation on the board: &pound;10.00 &ndash; &pound;3.00 = &pound;7.00</li>

                                the five key financial objectives students need to take away and they will need to be
                                sure of these for Task 1 in <strong>Student work 1</strong> (you may wish them to make a
                                note of these objectives in their exercise books if they have not already done so).
                                Alternatively, or in addition, you could display the <strong>Key definitions</strong> on

                                    objective (from <strong>Teaching session 1</strong>) is represented by each
                                    example.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students two minutes to categorise each objective correctly. They should work

                            <li>Suggest students try to remember the five different categories but that they can use the

                            <li>Discuss any issues arising. For example, some students could see the &lsquo;football
                                kits&rsquo; as relating to sales and that could be correct. Ask for the justification
                                and explain that often in business, a range of answers is possible, provided there is a
                                valid justification for them.</li>

                            <li>As the first question on the worksheet (where students choose their own business) is not
                                the primary focus of the task, stress that students should only spend a maximum of 4
                                minutes on this question. Tell them to focus on a small business that they are familiar
                                with from their local area or that a family member works in. If students are taking too
                                long to decide, give them the example of a small bakery on a local street to use.</li>
                            <li>For Question 2b, explain that the objectives should be realistic to the type and scale
                                of the chosen business &ndash; for example, something that could be achieved by a
                                relatively small business in its first year(s) of trading.</li>
                            <li>Ask volunteers to share their example objectives to check students&rsquo; understanding.

                        <p>For students who struggle with <strong>Financial objectives</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 1</strong>, some students may feel that objectives relating
                                to market share could also relate to sales. This is true and so reassure students that,
                                provided they give a suitable reason for the choice they have made, their answer would
                                still be valid. Explain that, in a formal exam, questions such as Q1.4 that could
                                potentially have either &lsquo;sales&rsquo; or &lsquo;market share&rsquo; as a possible
                                answer would only have one of those options available for students to choose as their
                                answer. Stress that examiners are not trying to &lsquo;catch students out&rsquo; or
                                trick them and so there would be no room for ambiguous answers that could create doubt
                                in their minds about whether two answers could possibly be correct.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Task 1</strong> of <strong>Student work 1</strong>, some students may have
                                difficulty classifying the business objectives. Suggest that they start by reviewing the
                                notes they took of the five categories of financial objectives (survival, sales, profit,
                                market share and financial security)<strong>.</strong></li>
                            <li>In <strong>Task 2</strong> of <strong>Student work 1</strong>, some students may
                                struggle to think of specific objectives of their own. It may help students if you show
                                <strong>Question 1</strong> from <strong>Task 1</strong> of <strong>Student work 1
                                </strong>to provide some examples of the types of objective for each category.

                            <li>Explain to students: <em>Understanding the kind of response that different questions
                                    need is crucial. It will help you to answer questions as quickly and effectively as

                            <li>This section of the lesson will introduce students to different styles of 1-mark
                                question.</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>What does the key business term &lsquo;objective&rsquo; mean?
                                </em>(Answer: A goal or target set by a business)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>We have just defined the term &lsquo;objective&rsquo;. This is a
                                    common type of exam question. It asks you to show your knowledge of key business
                                    terminology by providing a definition.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that when students are asked to &lsquo;define&rsquo; in an exam question, they
                                should explain the meaning of the key word, trying to use precise business language. For
                                certain key words, stating a formula will be sufficient. An example may be defining
                                profit by using the formula &lsquo;Total revenue &ndash; Total cost&rsquo;. Students
                                could also give an example in an answer to a &lsquo;define&rsquo; question; giving an
                                example will not be enough on its own but may help to convince an examiner if the
                                student has not been completely accurate in the definition they have given.</li>
                            <li>Show the <strong>Key definitions</strong> to illustrate how much detail is required.

                                &ldquo;Total revenue&rdquo;.&rsquo; They could note down their ideas in their exercise

                            <li>Ask a volunteer to provide an answer. (Possible answer: The money received from the sale
                                of goods and services)</li>
                            <li>If the volunteer did not answer with a formula, ask the rest of the class if anyone

                                revenue = Selling price &times; Quantity sold)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>&lsquo;Define&rsquo; is an example of a <strong>command
                                        word</strong>. A command word is the verb used in an exam question to explain
                                    what students need to do when giving their answer. In the exam, &lsquo;Define&rsquo;
                                    questions are worth 1 mark.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that another example of a command word is &lsquo;give&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>&lsquo;Give&rsquo; questions want you to state a simple piece of

                                    write one or two words to answer a &lsquo;Give&rsquo; question.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students to write an answer to the following question on mini whiteboards or pieces

                            <li>Tell students: <em>This shows that you can score 1/1 with just one word for a

                            <li>You could also explain that these three question types (<strong>define</strong>,

                            <li>Ask students: <em>What is another possible answer to the question about </em>The Range
                                <em>that uses a different financial objective?</em> (Possible answers: Sales revenue
                                from selling household goods; profit from selling furniture such as tables; market share
                                based on increasing the proportion of the UK&rsquo;s household goods that it supplies.)

                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 2</strong>, when considering <strong>Question 2</strong>,
                                some students may not initially be able to identify the business with the largest market
                                share from the pie chart. Explain that the entire circle of the pie chart represents the
                                combined total of different, individual components. In this pie chart there are three
                                components. Each coloured area represents the proportion of that total that each company
                                has &ndash; in other words, their market share. So, the largest area belongs to the
                                business with the largest market share.</li>
                            <button type="button" class="btn yl res3" data-id="l1p3_r7">Question 2</button>
                            <li>You could use the class as an analogy to help further. For example, ask students:
                                <em>There are 30 students in the class. We can divide them into those with short hair
                                    and those with long hair. What would these groups look like represented as a pie
                                    chart? </em>You could then draw a pie chart to show this representation.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 2</strong> and <strong>Student work 2</strong>, some
                                students may not be comfortable with the distinction between knowledge and application
                                as exam skills. Explain that &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; relates to factual understanding.
                                Ask them to think of the key terms from the lesson and illustrate that if, for example,
                                they can define &lsquo;Sales&rsquo;, they are showing knowledge. If they can then find a
                                word that has the same meaning as &lsquo;sales&rsquo; or relates to the concept of
                                sales, they are applying that understanding of the meaning of &lsquo;sales&rsquo; to a
                                piece of relevant information and so their answer is using their core knowledge and
                                relating it to the outside world: the skill of application.</li>
                            <li>There is an example of this in Question 3 of <strong>Worksheet 2</strong>, where
                                students are asked to identify the value of sales from a table and need to identify a
                                word with the same meaning from the table and then quote the value of total revenue (or
                                sales).</li>

                            <li>For each objective, ask the class to hold up mini whiteboards to show which of the five

                            <li>Ask a student who has the correct answer on their mini whiteboard to explain how they
                                knew it belonged in their chosen category. For example, if an objective is &lsquo;Have
                                2,000 subscribers to the website by the end of the year&rsquo; they might explain that
                                this relates to &lsquo;sales&rsquo; because each person who subscribes to the website is
                                a customer and so represents a &lsquo;sale&rsquo; of the company&rsquo;s services.</li>
