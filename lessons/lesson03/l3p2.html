                            <li>Draw students&rsquo; attention to how the business&rsquo;s objectives changes over time.

                                that affects its objectives.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>As businesses change and evolve over time, so do their objectives.
                                    Amazon focused on growth for the first 10 years of its existence, during which it
                                    made losses in order to increase its market share. Once it had become market leader
                                    in a number of markets, it changed its focus to objectives relating to profit.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Changes in the size of a business may also lead their objectives to
                                    change. Small businesses have less than 50 employees while large businesses have
                                    more than 250.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you suggest why the size of a business might affect its
                                    objectives?</em> Students may find it useful to think about specific businesses they
                                are familiar with. For example a small business local to them and a large business they
                                have bought goods from. Discuss students&rsquo; ideas. (Possible answers:

                                    <li>Small companies may sell just a tiny proportion of the total sales in a market
                                        so could be unlikely to focus on market share. Market share may be important for
                                        the largest companies in an industry.</li>
                                    <li>Small companies may be owned by just one person and so have their owner&rsquo;s

                                        owned by many different shareholders who will each focus on the company being as

                            <li>Tell students: <em>The performance of a company may also mean that there is a need to
                                    change its objectives. For example, a company pursuing a sales or growth objective
                                    was successful in increasing the volume of goods sold. However, this has led to
                                    falling profits because they cut prices to sell more. They might decide that now
                                    that customers have tried their products and hopefully liked them, the time is right
                                    to increase prices and so focus on becoming more profitable. As a real example,
                                    Netflix kept price rises to a minimum for the first 8 years of its streaming service
                                    as it grew its user base and achieved their market share and sales objectives. It
                                    then increased the price of its standard service in the US from $10.99 to $15.49
                                    within 4 years.</em></li>

                        </ul>


                        <h4>Answer</h4>

                        <p><strong>How might a company like SuperSkiSwiss.com change its objectives as it evolves?
                                Provide two reasons in your analysis.</strong></p>
                        <p>Over a period of time, as businesses like SuperSkiSwiss.com evolve, aims and objectives are
                            likely to change. This is usually because businesses have to respond to certain events or
                            changes in circumstances. For example, businesses like SuperSkiSwiss.com operate in dynamic
                            markets. This means they have to deal with regular changes. For example, a new entrant may
                            appear in the market, a rival might introduce a new product or the economy may start to
                            decline. When market conditions change it may be necessary to set new objectives. In this
                            case the fashion industry is highly competitive. For example, if trading becomes difficult
                            as a result of more intense competition, SuperSkiSwiss.com may decide that survival is more
                            important than rapid growth until the market 'settles down'.</p>
                        <p>New legislation might also have an impact of the objectives of a business. In recent years
                            many business have become more socially responsible. This may be a reaction to new
                            environmental, employment or consumer legislation.</p>
                        <p>In this case, SuperSkiSwiss.com claims that it wants to grow in a sustainable way. As a
                            result, for example, the businesses is committed to the protection of the environment. This
                            might be the result of a growing body of legislation passed to help protect the environment.
                            SuperSkiSwiss.com aims to use resources as efficiently as possible by controlling emissions,
                            and focusing on the sustainability of packaging. In 2016/17 SuperSkiSwiss.com cut its carbon
                            emissions by 15 per cent. It also reduced its stock and vehicle movements across Europe and
                            saved 11 tonnes of materials by reducing the number of swing tags (product labels) used.
                            These results suggest that SuperSkiSwiss.com may have modified its objectives as a result of
                            environmental legislation.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the reasons for a business changing its objectives are often due to external
                            factors. These are factors which are beyond the control of businesses. However, sometimes a
                            business such as SuperSkiSwiss.com might change its objectives for internal reasons. For
                            example, there may be change in the senior management team. In such circumstances the
                            objectives might change. For example, new senior managers might want to pursue profit
                            maximisation so that higher dividends can be paid to shareholders. However, there is no
                            evidence in this case to suggest that SuperSkiSwiss.com has made any such changes.</p>

                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 1</strong>, some students may struggle with thinking about
                                why the size of a company might affect its objectives. Suggest that they think about why
                                a small family-run grocery store may have different objectives to a big supermarket such
                                as Walmart (or CR Vanguard &ndash; the market leader in China with sales of 95billion
                                Yuan in 2019).</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1</strong>, <strong>Task 2 </strong>some students may struggle
                                to work out how to structure a response to Chapter question 6 on p. 18 of the
                                <strong>Student Book</strong>. Suggest they start by reviewing the factors that might
                                cause a business&rsquo;s objectives to change (three are answers to <strong>Worksheet 1,
                                    Task 1</strong>) and then re-reading the case study text to see where there are
                                examples of those factors. They may then be able to think about how those factors may
                                have influenced SuperSkiSwiss&rsquo;s objectives. (Those objective changes may be quite
                                similar to those from <strong>Worksheet 1, Task 1.</strong>)

                                    new models to fit with the change in the law. This might lead to a return to a sales

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Technological change happens continuously and often presents
                                    opportunities; for example, Netflix initially rented and sold films on DVD through
                                    the post, but the advent of streaming meant this became unprofitable so the company
                                    changed from focusing on sales to an objective based on developing its own content
                                    and allowing users to stream it. It also often presents threats; for example,
                                    Blockbuster in the UK could not cope with the advent of streaming and so went out of
                                    business.</em></li>
                            <li>Explain that technological change does not just affect the product a company sells, but
                                how it sells it (over the internet, as a virtual product rather than a physical one
                                (computer games)) and also how it makes it.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 5.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Technological progress allows better machines to be created which can
                                    produce larger quantities of products more quickly. This is linked to an
                                    <strong>economy of scale</strong> (the advantage a company can receive from selling
                                    greater quantities of goods) where larger companies can afford more expensive
                                    machinery that allows them to produce their products in far greater quantities and
                                    at much lower costs. These companies are likely to also practise
                                    <strong>automation</strong>, where they replace human workers with machines and so
                                    save money on wages.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 3 minutes to discuss in pairs about how automation and economies of scale
                                might affect either the company that is automating production or its rivals who do not
                                benefit from economies of scale. Ask for volunteers to share their answers and discuss
                                as a class. (Possible answers:

                                    <li>The largest car companies can experience economies of scale where they can
                                        install robots that work 24 hours/day to assemble parts into a finished car,
                                        meaning the company can produce far more cars every day than if it relied on
                                        humans to assemble the car. This might mean that in the short term the company
                                        might focus on survival while it pays for installing the automated production
                                        but allow it to then follow a growth objective before finally benefitting by
                                        focusing on profit due to the lower costs it has once the robots have been paid

                                        This could force it to abandon objectives relating to market share or sales and
                                        to focus just on survival.)</li>

                            <li>In <strong>Teaching session 2</strong>, some students may struggle with understanding an
                                economy of scale. Get them to think about how much it costs to buy a single can of Coca
                                Cola from a small shop (&pound;1) and then ask if they know how much a 12-can pack might
                                cost from a supermarket (12 cans for &pound;6 and so only 50p each). So it is cheaper to

                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2</strong>, some students may struggle to get started with
                                Question 4. They may benefit from an example to help them understand the requirements of
                                the task or how to approach it. Use an example (from <strong>Worksheet 2
                                    Answers</strong>) to give them a model of what each of the three question parts
                                (a&ndash;c) requires, then suggest that they focus on each of the three parts in
                                succession. For example:

                                    <li>c) Peloton added lots of new instructors to the platform to provide users with a

                                influencing factor. (Possible answers might be:

                                    <li>Yoti &ndash; the owners might decide to change from a sales objective (which has
                                        been satisfied) to one of profit or perhaps personal financial security by
                                        selling the business</li>
                                    <li>Rosebank &ndash; the founder may have initially set up the company for reasons
                                        relating to wanting to reduce head injuries among cyclists (a social objective)
                                        and then, following the change in the law, seen that this also allowed them to
                                        have a profit objective</li>
                                    <li>Twitter &ndash; had focused initially on growth to attract as many users as
                                        possible, following the change of leader this focus might change to become one
                                        relating to profit given how much the purchase cost</li>
                                    <li>Google might switch from focusing on market share (it is the largest search
                                        engine in many countries) and focus instead on profit</li>
                                    <li>Credit Agricole might find that in addition to making more profit it might also
                                        have to set some objectives relating to social objectives (for example by
                                        allowing families that struggle financially to have more time to repay their
                                        debts))</li>
