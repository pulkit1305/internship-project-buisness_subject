                            <li>Tell students: <em>There are many different ways of defining globalisation, but a key feature is that people and businesses increasingly think on a worldwide, rather than a local or even national scale.<br /></em><em>Businesses increasingly view the world without thinking about borders between countries and so just as one big market. This market allows them to sell goods or services anywhere in the world. They can also produce products wherever they choose. Businesses will often use staff born in many different countries to make their goods or deliver their services. This is what we think of as globalisation and it is a trend which has been going on for several centuries. However, the pace has increased rapidly over the last 50 years or so.</em></li>

                                <li>Ask students: <em>Who can remember what &lsquo;<strong>interdependence</strong>&rsquo; means and the context within which we have used the word in recent lessons? </em>(Interdependence was discussed in Lesson 11 &ndash; the classification of businesses.)</li>
                                <li>Discuss interdependence briefly as a class, guiding students towards the answer: <em>interdependence means that businesses, consumers or governments rely on other businesses to be able to successfully carry out their normal activities. For example, we used the word within the context of businesses in different sectors of the economy, so that a secondary manufacturer of bread would be interdependent on a farmer to grow the wheat for them. A farmer would then be reliant on bakeries to buy their produce.</em></li>
                                <li>Tell students: <em>This idea of interdependence increasingly links countries and the businesses and consumers within them. For example, today about 50% of global trade is international, whereas 50 years ago global trade made up about 10% of all trade. At this time, the UK was still producing a lot of its energy from coal mined in the UK, but it now buys most of its coal from Australia on the other side of the world. The UK has become more and more reliant on producers in another country for a vital source of energy. </em></li>

                                <li>Give students 2 minutes to answer the question. They should work individually, copying the features of globalisation into their exercise books and matching them to any examples they are sure of.</li>
                                <li>Taking each feature one at a time, ask students to hold up their answers on mini whiteboards or pieces of paper.</li>

                                <li>Click on Slide 3 to confirm the correct pairings. Talk through the points one by one, allowing students to complete any notes they want to make:
                                <ul class="square">
                                <li>1e:<em> Increased capital flows mean that businesses and governments in countries that may lack a reliable banking system can now borrow money from large banks in foreign countries, allowing them to invest and grow. This also presents a growth opportunity for those banks who can make money around the world.</em></li>
                                <li>2d:<em> Free trade is a defining feature of globalisation as it reduces barriers to doing business in different countries, increasing the amount of competition that companies have and so forcing them to offer better quality goods and lower prices.</em></li>
                                <li>3a:<em> Free movement of people means workers may be able to travel to other countries where their skills are in greater demand and so receive higher wages. This has also allowed businesses to access a wider pool of talented people and so improve the quality of goods that they can produce.</em></li>
                                <li>4b:<em> Because American citizens import so many goods from China, if there is a downturn in the American economy, it is likely to reduce the level of income which Chinese exporters receive. This will mean that less money flows around China&rsquo;s economy. </em></li>
                                <li>5c:<em> Technology transfer has sped up the rate of improvement as entrepreneurs are able to combine the best technologies from around the world into their products, improving the goods they offer to consumers. </em></li>
                                </ul>

                                <li>Tell students: <em>As well as technical knowledge, <strong>intellectual property</strong> can also be shared easily. This allows people in different countries to use or further build on great ideas and inventions and so improve living standards.</em></li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>If a business hopes to sell its products to consumers in all countries in the world, it will be selling in a global market, to the largest possible number of customers.</li>
                            <li>The global demand for cars is growing. In 2015, global sales reached 72.37 million. By the end of 2016, it is expected that sales will reach the 75 million mark. One of the main reasons for this growth is the rising demand in emerging economies. Sales in China, for example, were around 25 million in 2015. This is about one third of the total sold. Emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are becoming wealthier as they develop. This means that people in these countries can afford to buy cars &ndash; many perhaps for the first time.</li>
                            <li>\(\frac{10.08+9.87+7.99+7.49+6.40+5.17}{72.37}\times100\)<br>
                            \(\frac{47}{72.37}\times100=65.69\;per\;cent\)</li>
                            The six major car producers in the world share 65.69 per cent of the global car market.
                            <li>One reason why Japanese car manufacturers might have started to dominate the world economy is because they produce cars more efficiently. Information in the case study says that the emerging Japanese car producers are leaner, that is, more efficient. This means they can produce cars more cheaply and sell them at a lower price. Consequently they have taken market share from the US producers that used to dominate the market.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Another reason is due to the transfer of technology whereby Japanese businesses can benefit from advances in manufacturing made anywhere in the world. This means that their cars have a reputation for quality and so sell in higher volumes than those produced in countries which have not embraced new technologies to the same extent. Furthermore, the ability to borrow internationally has allowed Japanese businesses to &lsquo;import&rsquo; those technologies because car manufacturing involves high degrees of automation, using robots that cost millions of dollars and so not all businesses can access the capital they need to implement technologically advanced manufacturing.</p>

                            <p>For students who struggle with<strong> The concept of globalisation:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1, Task 1</strong>, some students may struggle to work out which gaps have no word listed in the word bank. If necessary, tell them that the second and fourth gaps do not have words listed in the word bank.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1, Task 2</strong>, some students may struggle to remember the formula for calculating market share (Question 3). Tell them they should work out the proportion of the total number (or value) of sales of a particular good that is made by the six biggest businesses added together. Students then need to find information about the total global sales of cars and that this is in the text on p. 65 of the <strong>Student Book</strong>. If students still cannot work out how to calculate the market share, suggest they add up the sales in millions of each of the six businesses shown and use the &lsquo;total sales&rsquo; figure for 2015 found in the final paragraph of the text on p. 64.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1, Task 2</strong>, some students may struggle to think of reasons that Japanese car businesses have become dominant (Question 4). Suggest that they re-read the missing words activity they have just completed as there are some key features of globalisation which will be relevant. (Although warn them that not all of the factors will necessarily relate to producing cars in Japan.)</li>

                            <li>Air travel has become quicker and planes can travel further. This has allowed more people to travel and be exposed to different countries. They may feel more able to take jobs in foreign countries due to the &lsquo;reduced distances/shrinking world&rsquo; offered by air travel, allowing businesses to access more skilled labour and improve their production.</li>
                            <li>Container ships can transport far greater quantities of goods than was previously possible. This has reduced the cost of selling goods in foreign markets, allowing businesses to offer lower prices while still making more profits. These profits encourage more businesses to &lsquo;think globally&rsquo; and design products that appeal to consumers regardless of nationality, thus increasing globalisation.</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Another reason linking improved transportation to globalisation is <strong>specialisation</strong>. With improved transport links, many businesses have chosen to make products in just one location and then export those goods to the rest of the world. By focusing production in just one place, the workers there can specialise on that particular product and become highly skilled, making production much more efficient and allowing the cost of making each product to fall. Many countries have also specialised, relying on imports of goods they do not specialise in and focusing their efforts on a few types of good that they are exceptionally good at producing and selling to customers around the world. For example, Germany is the world&rsquo;s biggest exporter of cars, specialising in producing luxury brands such as Porsche, Mercedes and BMW. Some of the money it earns from those exports allows it to be the world&rsquo;s biggest importer of cheese, possibly because it shares a border with France which specialises in cheese production. </em></li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>We are going to look at how to develop a &lsquo;chain of reasoning&rsquo;. This is a way of developing an explanation that links a cause to an effect. A chain of reasoning is a very useful way of building up the level of detail in the answers you provide to exam questions.</em></li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the first link in the chain and tell students: <em>this is another reason for globalisation shown by the image we looked at. The reason is explained but the way in which it creates the effect is not yet described.</em></li>
                            <li>Click again to reveal the next link in the chain and tell students: <em>This link in our chain allows us to develop an aspect of the reason by explaining how it impacts the business. In this example the aspect is transporting greater volumes and the reason is through lower costs and higher profits.</em></li>
                            <li>Click again to reveal the final link in the chain and tell students: <em>This final link connects the original reason of <strong>containerisation</strong> to its effect, which is increased globalisation.<br /></em><em>This chain of reasoning can help to illustrate your understanding of International GCSE Business.</em></li>

                            <li>Ask students: <em>How might the business activity shown in the image lead to greater globalisation? Write a chain of reasoning for this image.</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 3 minutes, working individually, to write their own chains of reasoning in their exercise books. Tell them they should include three links that explain how the business activity in the image might lead to greater globalisation.</li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, interrupt students and check that all have interpreted the image as &lsquo;tourism&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer to share the first sentence they have written for their chain of reasoning. The intention is to ensure that all students are able to start their &lsquo;chains&rsquo; and so may use the student&rsquo;s suggestion if they have been unable to start the exercise.</li>
                            <li>Guide students so that an initial sentence might read:

                            <li>Increased levels of tourism mean that people are far more used to travelling internationally and meeting people from different countries, with different cultures, traditions and products.</li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Additionally, consumers can take foreign holidays, providing businesses in the tourism industry with more customers. This increased opportunity to travel can also open up consumer&rsquo;s minds to the customs, products and people of other countries, further fuelling the process of globalisation.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 5 and tell students to make a note of the five factors leading to globalisation.</li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>How do you think &lsquo;developments in technology&rsquo; have led to greater globalisation?</em></li>
                            <li>Possible answers:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li>The internet has dramatically improved communication by allowing large amounts of information to be shared across the world at the click of a button.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, a consumer who wishes to find a product can perform an internet search and find a range of alternatives in minutes from companies around the world.</li>
                            <li>This gives businesses access to a very wide range of customers and means that even small businesses can sell their goods in foreign markets and so encourages them to think globally: a key aspect of globalisation.</li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> Businesses in more economically developed countries have found that their home markets have become <strong>saturated</strong>. This means that there are few opportunities to increase their sales and profits in those well-established markets. Instead, those businesses are looking at <strong>emerging economies</strong> where incomes are rising more rapidly to try to increase their sales. Focusing on ensuring their products are suitable for consumers in many different countries increases the alignment of businesses and consumers in different countries. This increasingly global outlook has been crucial in driving greater globalisation. </em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Governments also play a key role in driving globalisation.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer: <em>Can you suggest how governments can do this?</em> Suggest they refer to an aspect of international trade that they looked at in the last lesson (see <strong>Lesson 14</strong>).</li>

                            <li>The number of passengers carried rose from 642 million to 3441 million between 1980 and 2015. The percentage increase is given by:</li>
                            \(\frac{3.441-0.642}{0.642}\times100\)<br><br>
                            \(\frac{2.799}{0.642}\times100=435.9\;per\;cent\)
                            <li>One of the features of globalisation is that people are free to live and work in any country they choose. This has resulted in more multicultural societies where people from many different nations live and work in the same city. This increase in the movement of people around the world has increased demand for transport, such as air travel.<br />Also, rising trade between nations will increase the need for business people to meet up. There has been an increase in the number of business people using airlines as they travel to meet foreign business colleagues. Globalisation has also resulted in the increased transportation of goods around the world. The airline industry will have benefited from this increase in shipping.</li>
                            <li>There are a number of reasons for the development of globalisation, for example, developments in technology. Modern computing allows firms to transfer complex data instantly to any part of the world. It also means that more people can work at home, or any other location that they choose as long as there is an Internet connection. Many people do not have to be office-based to do their jobs. This means it is easier for firms to have operations all over the world. The Internet also allows consumers to gather information and buy goods online from firms located in different parts of the world.<br />A second reason is deregulation around the world. For example, privatisation has allowed more competition in many industries. Also, a lot of the barriers to trade have been removed. An increasing number of economies are more open and more and more countries have stopped protecting domestic industries. Many countries have also simplified their monetary and legal systems to make international trading easier.</li>

                            <li>Read the first sentence of the first key term. Do <strong>not</strong> read the actual word itself as this is what students need to guess from your description.

                            <li><em>A country which until recently was not highly economically developed but has begun to experience rapid growth. Examples might include countries such as Brazil and India.</em> (Answer: Emerging economy)</li>
                            <li><em>This can be carried out by businesses or a country. It involves focusing on producing just a limited range of goods. It is intended to improve efficiency by allowing workers to focus on just a few tasks that they become expert in. </em>(Answer: Specialisation)</li>
                            <li><em>This is something often faced by large businesses when nearly all consumers in their home markets already own the product they sell. It may lead the business to seek new places to sell the product where consumers have not had the chance to buy the good before. It occurs when so much has already been sold that there is no more demand for the good as everyone already owns it. </em>(Answer: Saturated market)</li>
                            <li><em>Reasons for this include improved transport, better communications and the growth of trade blocs. This involves the growing integration of the world&rsquo;s economies, businesses and people. </em>(Answer: Globalisation)</li>
                            <li><em>This occurs when the actions of one business affect the behaviour of another. An example might be when a cinema decides to cut its ticket prices and this has an impact on the only other cinema in the town. </em>(Answer: Interdependence)</li>
                            <li><em>This relates to the removal of barriers that might prevent businesses in one country selling to consumers in another. It has been aided by the growth of trade blocs and other forms of international co-operation. </em>(Answer: Free trade)</li>
                            <li><em>This is a term relating to the movement of money between the economies of the world. An example would be when an American bank invests in a Thai bank and transfers money into the Thai economy. </em>(Answer: International capital flows)</li>
