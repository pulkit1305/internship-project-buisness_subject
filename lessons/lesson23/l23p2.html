                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can anyone tell me what a <strong>trade bloc</strong> is?</em> Allow students to share their ideas.</li>
                            <li>Display Slide 1 of the slideshow and tell students to make a note of the definition.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students to suggest features of a trade bloc to help develop their understanding.</li>
                            <li>Display Slide 2 and tell students to make a note of the information.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                            <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>Trade blocs aim to increase economic integration between the countries within the bloc by bringing them closer together and removing barriers to their companies, workers, consumers and governments working and trading together. Whilst <strong>trading barriers</strong> are reduced within the bloc, a consistent set of barriers are usually enforced on trade from businesses in countries outside the bloc.</em></li>
                            <li><em>It is important to remember that not all trade blocs have exactly the same features. For example, the EU is a very closely integrated bloc. Most of its 27 European members share the same currency, some legislation is shared and, where there are no internal border checks on movement of people, workers can work in any member country they choose. In contrast, the USMCA between Mexico, the USA and Canada is a much looser agreement with none of the above features. However, the countries co-operate to build closer trade links. For example, it was recently agreed that worker rights enjoyed by General Motors staff in the USA should also be extended to a General Motors factory in Mexico to ensure alignment across the bloc.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Slide 2 shows that trade blocs tend to remove or reduce certain barriers to businesses in the member countries trading between themselves. </em></li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to remind themselves of examples of some of these potential barriers to international trade that were discussed in <strong>Lesson 15</strong> on globalisation. They should discuss their ideas with a partner.</li>
                            <li>Share ideas as a class and list them on the board.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3 to reveal a list of barriers to international trade.</li>
                            <li>For each of the barriers listed, ask a different volunteer to explain how it would negatively affect a company wanting to trade internationally. If students do not know the meaning of <strong>tariffs</strong>, tell them: <em>A tariff is a form of trade barrier that involves placing a tax on the import of goods or services from abroad.</em></li>
                            <li>Possible answers:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li>Border checks and controls take up a lot of time, increasing costs and limiting the export of goods with short &lsquo;shelf lives&rsquo; (e.g. fresh produce)</li>
                            <li>Tariffs increase the cost of importing goods into a country and so reduce international competitiveness</li>
                            <li>Quotas limit the amount of products which can be imported, meaning businesses may not be able to secure vital supplies</li>
                            <li>Administrative barriers such as strict product quality checks or excessive documentation take up large amounts of time and so increase costs</li>
                            <li>Subsidies paid to domestic businesses disadvantage foreign businesses from entering new markets and competing.</li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                            <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>The removal of some or all of these barriers if a trade bloc is set up, or if a country joins one, means that businesses will not suffer these drawbacks. There are a number of benefits that arise from this. One significant benefit for businesses is that they have better access to a wider market and so can sell their goods to more consumers. Another benefit which stems from this is that because they can sell a good to a much greater number of consumers, the business can specialise and so begin to benefit from economies of scale by producing or selling in larger quantities. Businesses can also produce goods across different countries, where workers may specialise in one particular area or where labour costs are lowest, improving their overall efficiency. </em></li>
                            <li><em>A <strong>quota</strong> is a legal maximum limit on the number of a specific type of good that can be imported into a country. It is a form of <strong>protectionism</strong> for domestic companies who face reduced international competition but quotas may hinder importers if they cannot source vital components for production.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to try to match a &lsquo;feature&rsquo; of a trade bloc with the most appropriate benefits to businesses in member nations. They should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Tell students that they should try to work out the order in which they would explain the benefits if they were writing an exam answer. Warn them that they may be asked to justify their choices.</li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>When answering these types of questions in exams, it is a good idea to start with the &lsquo;feature&rsquo; as this shows the skill of application (AO2) because you show understanding in the context of the question by identifying a relevant feature of a trade bloc. The first part of your analysis (AO3) will usually come from an explanation of <strong>how</strong> that feature creates a certain impact on the business, with the final element being the way that impact ultimately affects the business. This final effect is often one that occurs at a &lsquo;higher level&rsquo;. For example, &ldquo;a good example &ndash; the feature &ndash; should allow students to understand how to make a clear link between the instruction and how to answer a question (the first part of the analysis) so that they learn how to approach the answers to different exam questions (the ultimate effect).&rdquo; </em></li>
                            <li>If necessary, support students by telling them that there are three features of trade blocs listed on the slide.</li>
                            <li>After 2 minutes, ask a student to suggest a feature of a trade bloc and how it impacts businesses.</li>
                            <li>Repeat for the other two features.</li>
                            <li>Probable answers:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li>Free movement of labour means that businesses can access a wider &lsquo;pool&rsquo; of workers to choose the best from so that they become more productive</li>
                            <li>Banning subsidies to domestic businesses removes a form of protectionism against international competition and forces businesses to find internal methods of reducing their costs</li>
                            <li>Improved political and business relationships mean that trust is enhanced and cultures come together so that new trade relationships are discussed and developed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>Of course, if a country were to leave the trade bloc, these benefits would no longer be available to them. This has not happened very often, but an example was that in 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU so that it did not have to open its borders to workers from other member countries and its businesses did not have to stick to all of the laws that the EU had agreed.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                            </li>

                            <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>There are a number of disadvantages of being part of a trading bloc. For example, the barriers on trading with businesses outside of the bloc make imports of raw materials or components more expensive and so increase costs. Similarly, other trade blocs will impose restrictions and barriers on imports into their member countries, which may limit the countries that businesses can sell to or make doing so more expensive.</em></li>
                            <li><em>Another disadvantage is that many trade blocs prevent member nations from being members of any other trade blocs or having independent trade agreements with any other nations. This was another significant factor behind the UK leaving the EU because it chose to try to pursue trade deals with other countries such as Japan and the USA. (Trade blocs usually operate on a regional basis, although the RCEP brings together countries as far away as China and New Zealand.)</em></li>
                            <li><em>Finally, one further disadvantage for businesses is that they have to follow common rules and regulations in order to trade with other countries internally. Again, some people in the UK felt that the EU&rsquo;s legislation and regulations on its banking and financial sector was too strict and they wanted to leave to give businesses in those areas more freedom to operate</em>.</li>

                        <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>One likely problem related to joining a trade bloc is the changes which countries (and therefore the businesses operating in them) need to make in order to &lsquo;qualify&rsquo; to join a trade bloc. For example, Turkey has wanted to join the EU for quite some time but there are considerable delays because in order to do so, some quite large changes need to be made to legislation around issues such as working hours for staff and border controls. All of these delays and changes cause increased costs for businesses. </em></li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><em>In relation to leaving a trade bloc, this is relatively rare, however the main issues for business would be the uncertainty regarding which new restrictions they would face and the likelihood of increased trade barriers with countries they currently trade with. Another significant worry for the country itself would be the fact that large businesses will reduce investment if they think that a country leaving a trade bloc is cutting itself off from international trade. For example, the UK saw an 11% reduction in investment following its decision to leave the EU.</em></li>

                            <li>In<strong> Teaching session 1</strong>, when tackling the activity on Slide 4 of the slideshow<strong>, </strong>some students may struggle to work out the order in which to express the impacts on businesses of the features of trade unions and which of the impacts they relate to. Tell them the initial stage is to identify the feature and that there are three of them. They should then try to identify the most relevant impact that is associated with each feature. This will help them to narrow down the ultimate impacts on businesses. Tell students that these &lsquo;ultimate&rsquo; impacts often relate to costs and might not be exclusive to one specific feature. Also remind students that they can use as many connectives or longer phrases to link the features to impacts and the impacts together.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>Student work 1</strong>, when answering Question 6 of<strong> Worksheet 1</strong>, some students may struggle to decide about the categorisation of &lsquo;single currency&rsquo;.

                            <li>Tell students: <em>I am going to play you a short video clip about the impact of Brexit. Brexit is the name given to the UK (&lsquo;Britain&rsquo;) exiting from the EU. Listen out for the answer to this question in particular: Why is Nissan worried about the effects of Brexit and what has it done about it?</em></li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>How has Nissan responded to the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU?</em> (Answer: it has abandoned plans to build a new model of car at a factory in Northeast England.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Why has it chosen to do this after the Brexit decision was announced?</em> (Answer: They are concerned about the flow of components and finished goods across the UK&rsquo;s borders after Brexit.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What specific aspects of Brexit might Nissan have been concerned about in terms of the flow of components and finished goods? Why would that make them decide not to build a new model of car in a factory that had been set up for the purpose, with highly skilled staff?</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to discuss these questions in pairs.</li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, share ideas as a class.</li>
                            <li>Guide students towards the answer: The main concern is that following Brexit, the UK will no longer be able to benefit from the EU&rsquo;s free trade agreement. This means that there will be tariffs on imports and exports of goods between the UK and the EU.</li>

                            <li><em>In your exam, you might have a 6-mark &lsquo;analyse&rsquo; question where you might have to &lsquo;Analyse the impacts of Brexit on Nissan&rsquo;. Here, you have to focus on a specific company so you must make sure you apply any theory and analysis to Nissan. You have also been asked for impacts so need to provide two of them. You could simply have one effect being the tariffs on Nissan&rsquo;s imports and another &lsquo;impact&rsquo; being the tariff on their exports.</em></li>
                            <li><em>Work with a partner to discuss examples of the impacts of Brexit on Nissan and how you could develop those initial impacts into more detailed responses.</em> <em>You have 2 minutes and I will show some key phrases on the board that you could use in your responses. I will be looking to identify distinct elements within your response, which you could link together with connectives such as &lsquo;because&rsquo; or &lsquo;therefore&rsquo;. For example, &ldquo;a clear model for 6-mark answers allows students to understand exactly what is required of them, therefore they can apply their knowledge effectively to different questions which means that they can display good understanding in the correct way and so maximise the marks they score in exams.&rdquo;</em></li>

                            <li>After 2 minutes, ask for a volunteer pair to suggest their first impact. Before they start, ask the rest of the class to listen carefully to see whether they can identify distinct links in the chain of reasoning that students are trying to build in order to link Brexit to Nissan&rsquo;s decision.</li>
                            <li>Possible answer: <em>Brexit meant that the UK would no longer benefit from the free trade agreement in the EU and so UK-based businesses would face a tariff on goods they import. This means that imports of raw materials like steel from Germany will become more expensive for Nissan because they have to pay a tax to the UK government as well as the cost of the steel. This will increase their cost of production and make them less internationally competitive compared to a company like Peugeot in France who do not face any tariffs when importing steel from Germany. </em></li>
                            <li>Ask for a different student to volunteer. Tell that student that you will ask the first pair to repeat the answer that they have just given and the student should stop them every time they hear them complete a link.</li>

                            </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>This shows how just three linked chains can combine to form a powerful argument. Did you notice that each of the links started with a connective (a phrase which emphasises the link between the previous and next stages in the argument) or <strong>conjunction</strong>. Using these phrases can help you improve the continuity of your responses through building a chain of reasoning.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask for another pair to suggest a different answer, which is likely to be based on the impact of Brexit on export tariffs.</li>
                            <li>Possible answer: <em>Brexit will also mean that when Nissan tries to sell cars from its UK factory in Sunderland it will have a smaller market. This is because many buyers in the EU will find they face much higher prices because of the tariffs placed by the EU on UK exports. Therefore, a Polish customer is much more likely to choose a Seat produced in Martorell, Spain because they will pay a lower price due to the absence of the tariffs they would face if they bought a Nissan from the UK.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>If you were Aston Martin, a luxury car producer based in the UK, how do you feel the presence of tariffs after Brexit might benefit you in relation to competing in the UK market?</em></li>
                            <li>Share ideas in a brief discussion, guiding students towards the answer: It would benefit them, because imports of luxury Ferrari or Lamborghini cars from Italy would face a tariff. This would increase the price a UK consumer would have to pay for those brands and make the Aston Martin appear to be much more price competitive, which should increase their domestic sales. They would have been protected by the tariff.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>This is an example of the issue of protectionism that we mentioned earlier today. Governments may choose to employ protectionist policies to ensure domestic businesses do not face too much competition from abroad and so domestic jobs are protected from larger foreign rivals that could threaten the existence of the domestic businesses.</em></li>
                            <li><em>Tariffs are the most common form of protectionism for governments to use to try to protect the domestic economy because they are relatively simple to implement and because they create revenue for the government itself.</em></li>

                            <li>Give students 1 minute in pairs to identify which of the impacts on the board are advantages for domestic businesses from the use of tariffs and which are disadvantages.</li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, ask students: Which of the statements are disadvantages for domestic businesses? (Answers: A, D, E, F)</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Which of the statements has disappeared? Why?</em> (Answer: &lsquo;Consumers usually end up paying higher prices&rsquo; because although it is a disadvantage, it is based around consumers rather than businesses which was the question)</li>
                            <li>Remind students that it is important to read all questions very carefully, particularly in the exam, to ensure they give the information that is actually being asked for.</li>

                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2</strong>, some students may struggle to complete Questions 1 and 2. Suggest that the first step is to identify the initial impact of a tariff being imposed (or increased in value). They can then use information from the article to support their development of how that point would affect businesses. Suggest that they could also use any knowledge they have about the types of goods that China and the USA may each produce and trade to provide detail and application within their answer. If students still struggle to identify specific benefits/drawbacks, display Slide 4 of <strong>Slideshow: The impact of tariffs on business</strong> from <strong>Teaching session 2</strong> to display the points. You can provide children&rsquo;s toys and electrical items such as washing machines as examples of Chinese exports to the USA and airplanes and soya beans as examples of US exports to China.</li>

                            <li>It is not uncommon for governments to take measures to help the business sector. This is because businesses provide employment, generate income and provide tax revenues. A flourishing business sector is very good for the economy. In this case, the government has taken a number of measures to help businesses.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">The introduction of tariffs on a range of imported shoes, clothes and fashion accessories will help some businesses. If imports of these goods become more expensive it will be easier for domestic producers in these industries to compete and survive. Therefore clothes and shoe manufacturers, for example, should enjoy a boost in sales as their goods become relatively cheap compared to imports.</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Belonging to a trade bloc also gives them access to wider markets and can help to lower costs if economies of scale can be exploited when sales and output rise. Membership may also provide protection from large predatory multinationals from outside the bloc.</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">To conclude, all these measures can potentially help businesses, particularly those in the clothes, shoes and fashion accessories industries where competition has been reduced with tariffs on imports. However, the government is also cutting some expenditure and freezing public sector pay. These measures will have a negative impact on some businesses. Therefore the gains mentioned above might be cancelled out to a certain extent.</p>

                            <li>After 2 minutes, ask those pairs who felt the greatest benefit would be for the USA to raise their hands. Choose one of these pairs to explain why they felt that would be the case.</li>
                            <li>Possible answer: Because the value of goods the USA is placing increased tariffs on is greater than that which China is doing and so there is likely to be a greater gain in tax revenue for the US government than the Chinese.</li>
                            <li>Next, ask those pairs who felt the Chinese economy might benefit more to raise their hands. Choose one of these pairs to explain why.

                            <ul class="square">
                            <li>If American businesses leave China, there will be reduced competition in the Chinese market for domestic businesses and so they will benefit from increased sales and profits, providing benefits to the Chinese economy at the expense of the American economy.</li>
                            <li>Although more tax will be raised through tariffs, there will be a fall in US exports which the Chinese have placed tariffs on. This will lead to reduced profits for US businesses who will employ fewer workers and pay less tax. Therefore, government spending is likely to rise by a greater amount due to the need to support workers who lose their jobs.</li>

                            <li>Ask students to write C, US, B or N on a mini whiteboard to express their answers.</li>
                            <li>Ask a student who answered &lsquo;both&rsquo; would benefit for the reasons.</li>
                            <li>Possible answer:
                            <ul class="square">
                            <li>Because there will be an increased focus on producing for the domestic market, with fewer imports that would face tariffs anyway. In the long term, businesses will find cheaper ways of producing to replace imports and so will readjust. There will also be lower levels of pollution from the transport involved in trading goods between countries so far apart.</li>

                            <li>Possible answer:</li>

                            <li>There will be an overall increase in the cost of production for businesses who face increased tariffs on imports of raw material and components. Therefore their sales will fall and consumers will face higher prices. Also, those businesses will find it more difficult to export their goods, reducing demand and so threatening jobs.</li>

                            <li>Give students 1 minute to think about the question individually.</li>
                            <li>After 1 minute, give students a further minute to explain their ideas to a partner. Tell pairs: <em>You need to decide which of your suggestions would have the greatest benefit for businesses and be ready to explain why.</em></li>
                            <li>If necessary, give an example of the second bullet that in the UK, Sunday trading laws restrict how long businesses are allowed to open for and what they can sell, which restricts their sales.</li>
                            <li>Ask for a volunteer pair to explain the piece of legislation they wish to remove and the impact on business to the class. Tell the rest of the class to listen carefully and to identify any problems or issues they anticipate following the change.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to raise a hand if they can think of any drawbacks of the first pair&rsquo;s suggestion.</li>
                            <li>Ask the volunteer pair to respond to any objections and whether they feel they are valid and whether they would still go ahead with their suggestion.</li>
                            <li>Repeat for a second pair&rsquo;s suggestion.</li>
