                            <li>Choose a student to present information about one of the franchise opportunities that
                                they researched as part of their homework from the last lesson (<strong>Lesson
                                    8</strong>). Tell the student they have 1 minute to deliver all of the information
                                but not to say whether they would take out the franchise or not.</li>
                            <li>Tell the rest of the class: <em>Listen carefully to the information that is being
                                    presented so that you are able to ask questions relating to whether you think buying
                                    that franchise is a good idea or not.</em></li>
                            <li>Following the presentation, invite volunteers to ask questions about the franchise
                                opportunity. Spend 2 minutes on the questioning.</li>
                            <li>Sensible questions could include:

                                    <li>How much will the total costs be during the first year?</li>
                                    <li>How much additional investment will be needed and where will the student get
                                        that money from?</li>
                                    <li>Are any benefits (or costs) offered by that particular franchisor that we did
                                        not discuss during the last lesson?</li>

                            <li>Possible answers to benefits/costs question:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>During the course so far we have looked at businesses which have one
                                    key objective in common: they will all be trying to make a profit for the owners.
                                    Today, we are going to investigate a type of company that exists for a different
                                    reason: to provide a service to members of the public.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What are some examples of companies that exist to provide a service to
                                    members of the public?</em></li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>in order to focus on providing a service to the community, these
                                    businesses are not owned by private individuals who want to make money from owning
                                    them. Instead, they tend to be state-owned. This means they are owned by the
                                    government and operated on behalf of citizens. These companies are called
                                    <strong>public corporations</strong></em>.</li>
                            <li>Tell them:<em> Public corporations are incorporated businesses so they are officially
                                    separate legal entities from the people in government who run them. They are usually
                                    funded by the state or government and their managers are accountable to specific
                                    ministers within the government.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them:<em> In some countries, some public corporations may be run in order to make a
                                    profit, but this is not usually the case. Examples of public corporations operated
                                    in order to make a profit for their government, and therefore its citizens, are
                                    Emirates airlines, owned by the government of Dubai, and Norges Bank IM, owned by
                                    the Norwegian government. Both seek to make a profit in order to bring money in to
                                    the country for the government to spend on providing services for the citizens.

                            <li>Tell them: <em>Public corporations are often part of the <strong>public sector</strong>.
                                    We learned about this in <strong>Lesson 2</strong>. </em></li>
                            <li>Ask:<em> Can anyone tell me what the public sector is? </em>(Answer: The part of the
                                economy where businesses are operated by local or national governments.)</li>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> Businesses owned by private individuals are in the private
                                    sector.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 1 of the slideshow and tell students to copy the information into their

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you think of any businesses in this country which are owned and

                            <li>Possible answers:
                                <ul class="square">

                            <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to decide whether the features shown relate most closely to a
                                public or private sector business. They should work individually, noting their ideas in
                                their exercise books.</li>
                            <li>Taking each statement at a time, ask students to show their answers on mini whiteboards
                                or pieces of paper.</li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the correct answer. Ask a student who got the answer right to explain
                                why it is correct.</li>
                            <li>Move on to the next statement using the same process.</li>
                            <li>As you work through the statements, resolve any issues or misunderstandings. For
                                example:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>&lsquo;Aims to maximise profit&rsquo; &ndash; although some public corporations
                                        aim to make a profit, this is more generally applicable to private sector
                                        businesses. Often a public corporation that tries to make a profit may also have
                                        other aims, such as a state-owned airline that wants to bring more visitors to a
                                        country, elevate the country&rsquo;s public image or publicise the country.</li>
                                    <li>&lsquo;Funded by the government&rsquo; &ndash; although some governments may
                                        make contributions to the running of private sector businesses (for example,
                                        paying farmers to ensure there is enough food or providing funding to
                                        charities), public corporations often receive all of their funding from the
                                        government (e.g. state-run schools or the police force). General taxation is
                                        used to provide that funding.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>The Ugandan National and Water Sewerage Corporation is owned by the Ugandan government
                                and run by a board of directors, which is accountable to a government minister.</li>
                            <li>The main objective of NWSC is to provide a public service; it has committed to the
                                provision of good quality customer service. NWSC aims to supply everyone with clean safe
                                water within 200 metres of all towns and urban centres (coverage is currently 78 per
                                cent). On the NWSC website, it states that &lsquo;The Customer is the reason we exist.
                                We do everything to the delight of our customer.&rsquo;</li>
                            <li>In the private sector, most businesses aim to make a profit. However, organisations in
                                the public sector aim to provide a public service. Sometimes providing a public service
                                may be unprofitable, therefore, private sector firms would not be interested in
                                supplying the market. Consequently the government needs to run and own organisations so
                                that the provision of particular public services can be funded from taxpayers&rsquo;
                                money.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Also, some industries, like water supply, are crucial to the well-being or security of the
                            nation. Therefore, since they are so important, it is arguably better if the government
                            takes control so that supply and quality can be guaranteed.</p>

                            <li>In<strong> Student work 1</strong>, some students may struggle with Question 2 because
                                they find it difficult to identify a specific objective. Tell them to identify whether a
                                public corporation is likely to focus on financial or non-financial objectives. Next,
                                suggest they think about a general type of aim that many companies will have and then to
                                think about whether the case study suggests any numerical targets NWSC may use to
                                measure either its current or desired performance level against.</li>
                            <li>In<strong> Student work 1</strong>, some students may struggle with Question 3 because
                                they cannot appreciate the reasons private businesses may not find some markets
                                attractive. Suggest students scan the information on pp. 38 or 39 of the <strong>Student

                                    exactly what that police force should do, how they should do it or how the police
                                    should be paid. Some people would also not be able to pay anything because they
                                    would not be able to afford it.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>For some goods this would not be a problem </em><em>‒ for example, if you
                                    cannot afford a car or a foreign holiday, most societies accept you would not
                                    receive that good because a business needs to be able to charge you for it. This
                                    underpins most business transactions: that businesses exist to make a profit by
                                    providing the goods that consumers want to buy.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them:<em> However, for certain goods, we would want them to be available to

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Most countries provide some level of education for all children for
                                    free because there are a lot of benefits to the individual and society of being
                                    educated. Therefore, countries do not want those who cannot afford to pay for an
                                    education to miss out on those benefits. So having a public corporation to provide
                                    services such as education, street lighting or basic healthcare is deemed necessary
                                    to make society function and to improve the lives of the poorest people who would
                                    not be able to afford those goods or services themselves.</em></li>

                            <li>Explain that some goods, such as street lighting, would not be provided if left to
                                private companies because too few people would be prepared to pay. If only some people
                                paid, those who did not would still benefit from the lighting as you cannot block the
                                light from specific people. Therefore, no businesses could make a profit so the streets
                                would not be lit: this is why public corporations exist to meet the need for street
                                lighting and other similar goods and services.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Some businesses, such as Queen Alia International Airport in Jordan,
                                    were originally built and are still operated by the local or national government of
                                    a country. Other public corporations were originally owned by the private sector and
                                    then bought or taken into public ownership. This process is

                                    an industry or an area of the country are protected. It might also be because the
                                    products that a certain company makes are considered important for national defence:
                                    the ability to build airplanes or maintain satellites might be examples.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students to make a note of the reasons for public ownership.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>a <strong>natural monopoly</strong> exists in some industries. For
                                    example, it would not make sense for many different water supply companies to
                                    compete to pipe water into your homes. Therefore, just one company tends to supply
                                    water to a city, because they can dig just one set of pipes. This means the water
                                    supply industry is a natural monopoly because the most cost efficient way of
                                    supplying that product is to only have one company do so. Therefore, these companies
                                    may sometimes be public corporations.</em></li>
                            <li>Next, give students 1 minute to discuss in pairs reasons that public ownership might

                            <li>Tell students: <em>A key argument against public ownership is that it costs a lot of
                                    money to provide many services (for example health or education services) and so the
                                    costs have to be paid through taxes. Also, if companies are to be nationalised,
                                    there is a large one-off cost. In the article, Forgemasters &lsquo;only&rsquo; cost
                                    a relatively low &pound;2.6m but needs hundreds of millions of pounds of further
                                    investment, which taxpayers will have to provide. </em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>Another argument against public ownership is that the lack of a motive to
                                    make profits in the public sector can make companies inefficient. For example, would
                                    you be more careful about turning off lights at home or would you walk instead of
                                    using a car if you were paying for the electricity or petrol? In public sector
                                    companies, any losses resulting from a lack of control over spending and costs are
                                    paid by the government. In a private sector company, losses have to be covered by
                                    that company or they risk going out of business. So, in the public sector there may
                                    not be the same incentive to reduce costs or be efficient than in a private sector
                                    company.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>While there may be a strong argument for politicians to control companies
                                    in certain industries, not everyone agrees which businesses should be controlled by
                                    governments and which by private companies. Some people argue that too many
                                    industries are influenced by political reasons when companies are public
                                    corporations.</em></li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Privatisation is the process of transferring public sector resources, such as public
                                corporations, to the private sector. In this case, a number of airports and airport
                                facilities have been privatised. For example, in 2013, the Brazilian Government raised
                                US$9100 million by privatising two major airports ahead of the 2014 World Cup.</li>
                            <li>Governments have historically preferred to keep control of businesses operating
                                airports. Even as recently as 2006, only about 2 per cent of the world&rsquo;s airports
                                were owned or managed by the private sector. The reason for this is because airports are
                                considered as strategically important to the nation. If the provision of a particular
                                service is vital to the well-being or security of the nation it is considered desirable
                                for the government to maintain control so that continuity of supply and quality can be
                                guaranteed.</li>
                            <li>One motive for privatisation is to raise money. If the government sells a public
                                corporation, such as an airport, the money can be used by the government. In this case
                                for example, the Brazilian government plans to sell more airports to raise money to help
                                reduce its budget deficit. Another possible motive for privatisation is that airports
                                are likely to be run more efficiently in the private sector. According to Ahmed Bukalla,
                                director of operations at the Department of Civil Aviation, Sharjah International
                                Airport, UAE. &lsquo;When privatisation comes, there will be pressure for further
                                productivity gains, and airport operators will need to be even more innovative and adopt
                                new technologies to stay competitive.&rsquo; Therefore in the private sector businesses
                                will serve the public better because if they don't they risk &lsquo;going bust&rsquo;.

                                <li>No, because sometimes inefficient businesses need to fail because customers obviously did not want those products and so workers should not be kept in &lsquo;zombie jobs&rsquo; when they could start looking for work in profitable sectors of the economy.</li>
                                <li>Yes, because providing employment provides a minimum standard of living and this can be seen as an important responsibility of the government.</li>

                                <li>Private schools might only employ the teachers whose students got the best exam results</li>
