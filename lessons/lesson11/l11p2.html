                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain that students must work out which features relate to which types of business and
                                then identify the likely consequences of those features.</li>
                            <li>Students may notice that features might not apply to all businesses within a category.
                                For example, not all public companies will be &lsquo;Large organisation providing
                                services which private businesses are not willing to do as they provide services for
                                free&rsquo;. However, it should be clear that each feature can only fit with one form of
                                business ownership.</li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes, working individually, to complete the matching activity.</li>
                            <li>After 2 minutes, give students 1 minute to check answers with a partner and discuss any
                                disagreements.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 2 to show the answers and discuss.</li>
                            <li>Ask a student: <em>Which particular form of unincorporated business is being described?
                                    How do you know?</em> (Answer: sole trader as it refers to just one owner and has
                                unlimited liability; for example, a small building business.)</li>
                            <li>Repeat this process for the other three types of business ownership. Particular types
                                being described are:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Incorporated business: public limited company, due to ability to sell shares on
                                        the stock exchange (for example, Nike).</li>
                                    <li>Public business: public sector company, because providing services for free (at
                                        point of use) means that no private business or social enterprise would be able
                                        to operate (for example, the NHS in the UK)</li>
                                    <li>Social enterprise: worker cooperative, as it is owned directly by its members
                                        (workers); for example, Modragon &ndash; a Basque worker cooperative.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>We are going to look at the classification of businesses today. In
                                    Business we place companies into one of three different &lsquo;sectors&rsquo;
                                    depending on what their business activity is.</em></li>
                            <li><em>The first sector of the economy is the primary sector which involves extracting raw
                                    materials from the earth. Activity in this sector usually involves farming, fishing,
                                    forestry or mining.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students:<em> The main purpose of <strong>primary sector</strong> activity is to
                                    obtain raw materials. These raw materials may well not be used in the form they are
                                    extracted in. Instead, they are often processed into a finished product. This
                                    activity of turning a raw material into a finished good is what takes place in the
                                    <strong>secondary sector</strong>.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>There may well be different stages within the secondary sector. For example,
                                            a company which produces engine parts for jets is in the secondary sector
                                            and will sell those parts to a company such as Boeing who would use them to
                                            manufacture the finished plane. Both of the companies are in the secondary
                                            sector despite their supplier and customer relationship. </em></li>
                                    <li>A<em> <strong>chain of production</strong> refers to the stages which turn raw
                                            materials into components and then transform those components into finished
                                            goods that are ready for sale to consumers. The chain of production is what
                                            links the three sectors together and moves the product through its entire
                                            manufacture, moving closer to the consumer as it moves through the chain of

                            <li>Tell students: <em>The <strong>tertiary sector</strong> involves performing any type of
                                    service for consumers or selling any type of product to them. Explain that examples
                                    of tertiary activity include dentistry, retailing food, cleaning someone&rsquo;s
                                    house, performing at concerts or working as a sports coach.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide</li>
                            <li>Tell students they have 3 minutes to describe the chains of production which link the
                                activities on the slide. They should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Tell students to make sure they clearly identify which sector of the economy each of the
                                different processes belongs to.</li>
                            <li>Tell them: <em>There are five different primary sector activities and each is associated
                                    with two different secondary sector activities which support one tertiary sector
                                    activity. You should start by identifying all of the primary sector activities and
                                    then, one-by-one, link the secondary and tertiary sector activities to each primary
                                    activity in turn.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask a volunteer to suggest a chain of production that they have identified.</li>

                            <li>Tell the remainder of the class to listen and raise their hands when activity moves from
                                one sector to another.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3 to reveal the answers.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to work in pairs. Give them 2 minutes to suggest two further chains of
                                production for products or services of their choice. Ensure that they identify the
                                different activities that take place in each stage of production.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>For example, to produce this lightbulb, tungsten is mined, which is a
                                    primary sector activity. That raw metal is then processed, stretched and twisted in
                                    a factory to turn it into a filament which forms part of the lightbulb and is a
                                    secondary sector activity along with assembling the filament into the finished bulb.
                                    Tertiary sector activity would involve using the lightbulb to illuminate a room
                                    where students are being educated or simply selling the lightbulb to consumers.</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask for a pair to share one of their chains of production.</li>
                            <li>Repeat with another pair of students.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>All businesses within an economy will rely on other businesses to
                                    either supply them with raw materials or components or finished goods that they will
                                    use to deliver a service to their customers. This means that businesses are
                                    interdependent, because the activities of one business affect others within the
                                    economy because they are linked.</em></li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Draw students' attention to the case study &lsquo;Agricultural employment&rsquo; on p.
                                51 of the <strong>Student Book</strong>. (They have just looked at this as part of
                                <strong>Student work 2</strong>.)
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What sector of the economy is the olive farm in and why? (</em>Answer:
                                primary, because it involves agriculture &ndash; growing a crop.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Do you think that more or fewer people are employed in agriculture now
                                    compared to 100 years ago? Make sure you have a reason for your answer before
                                    putting your hand up. </em>Allow students to share ideas, guiding them to the
                                correct answer. (Answer: Fewer people are employed in the agricultural sector now than
                                100 years ago because of automation, where many jobs in farming can now be done by
                                machines rather than humans.)</li>
                            <li>Give an example to illustrate the answer: <em>For example, the family in the case study
                                    have thought about investing in machinery to reduce the number of people, and
                                    therefore the labour costs, involved in harvesting the olives.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>This is true of most primary sector activity. For example, mining
                                    used to be very <strong>labour intensive</strong>, using just basic hand-held tools,
                                    but is now performed by huge, earth-moving machines. This has improved the
                                    efficiency of mining, allowing far fewer workers to produce a much greater total
                                    output.</em></li>

                            <li>Lead a class discussion. Ask students to put their hands up if they think
                                &lsquo;increased efficiency&rsquo; is an advantage rather than a disadvantage and ask a
                                volunteer to explain why. Repeat for the other features.</li>
                            <li>Possible answers:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Increased efficiency is an advantage because it allows businesses to reduce the
                                        average cost of growing crops or extracting oil, meaning that those goods are
                                        cheaper for consumers.</li>
                                    <li>Lower employment is a disadvantage because there are fewer jobs available to the
                                        population, meaning incomes and living standards may fall.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced costs of production is an advantage as it allow businesses to increase
                                        the profits they make.</li>
                                    <li>Greater investment required can be a disadvantage because it makes it harder for
                                        small, family-run businesses to compete with bigger rivals.</li>
                                    <li>Work being much safer is an advantage because it reduces the risk of injury or
                                        death for workers.</li>
                                    <li>Greater total output is an advantage as it allows more finished goods to be
                                        created, improving living standards and allowing populations to grow.</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <strong><em>Industrialisation</em></strong><em> has meant that over the
                                    last 200 years the secondary sector has increased in size. The development of
                                    large-scale machinery allowed big companies to be created which revolutionised our
                                    society, giving us access to many new types of good and allowing us to buy better
                                    quality and much cheaper products of many different types.</em></li>

                                    within our country?</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute to discuss their opinions with a partner. Tell them they will
                                need to be able to justify their views.</li>
                            <li>Invite volunteer pairs to share their ideas and justify them.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>In many countries, a process of de-industrialisation has been taking place
                                            in recent years, where economic activity has moved from the secondary to the
                                            tertiary sector. This has occurred because many countries found that it was
                                            cheaper to buy manufactured goods from other countries where labour costs
                                            were lower. Therefore, the secondary sector in more-economically developed
                                            countries has declined over the last 50 years.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>In some developing countries, for example, Vietnam and Bangladesh, the

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Wages in the secondary sector have traditionally been higher (and
                                    employment more stable) than in primary sector industries. Therefore, changes in the
                                    structures of the economy have tended to be accompanied by rising living standards
                                    as those economies industrialised. More economically developed countries have
                                    recently been going through a process of <strong>de-industrialisation,</strong>
                                    where tertiary sector activity has become dominant.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to decide if the features represent those of the primary,
                                secondary or tertiary sectors. They should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Hold a quick class vote on each feature, asking students to identify the relevant sector
                                on mini whiteboards (P for primary, S for secondary, T for tertiary). Make a note of the
                                consensus on the board each time</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4 to reveal the answers.</li>
                            <li>Use the tertiary sector examples to explain:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>Many occupations within the tertiary sector tend to involve providing a
                                            service and involve the highest levels of skill within our economy. This
                                            means that the incomes generated and profits earned in this sector are high
                                            and many countries have sought to develop their tertiary sectors. For
                                            example, China has sought to develop its tourist industry as well as banking
                                            services and technology services because of the growth and revenue-earning
                                            opportunities these industries offer. </em></li>
                                    <li><em>Many jobs are also being created in the tertiary sector because there have
                                            been fewer opportunities for labour to be replaced by capital in this part
                                            of the economy and higher levels of income mean consumers demand more and
                                            more services, whereas there is a limit to how many primary goods can be
                                            consumed. Many service-sector jobs are very labour-intensive and cannot
                                            easily be automated.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>High income countries also tend to generate lots of tax that allows
                                            governments to expand the range of services provided by the public sector,
                                            such as healthcare or higher education. Therefore, the tertiary sector may

                                The output from the primary sector has increased because production has become more
                                efficient over time.)</li>
                            <li>Explain: <em>One major reason that primary sector activity has increased is because it
                                    has become increasingly automated, which has reduced the number of people employed
                                    but significantly raised the overall level of output.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 6 and tell students to display the correct answer on a mini whiteboard.
                                They should identify that the answer is &lsquo;True&rsquo;.</li>
                            <li>Ask a student: <em>Can you explain why this statement is true?</em> (Possible answer:
                                because some countries are more suited to perform different types of activity)</li>
                            <li>Explain: <em>They may have more available natural resources like coal or forests and so
                                    specialise in primary activity, while other countries with highly educated
                                    populations tend to focus on providing services, which involves high levels of skill
                                    or training.</em></li>

                            </strong>The pie charts in Figure 7.3 show some important changes in the amount of
                            employment in different sectors of the economy between 1990 and 2015. In 1990, China
                            employed 60 per cent of its workforce in agriculture. By 2015, this had fallen to just 28.3
                            per cent. In contrast, the number of people employed in the tertiary sector rose from 18 per
                            cent to 42.4 per cent. Employment in the secondary sector also grew from 22 per cent to 29.3
                            per cent. These changes have resulted in a more balanced economy for China. It was less
                            dependent on agriculture in 2015 as it was in 1990. However, if the changes follow the same
                            trend, China&rsquo;s economy may become more unbalanced in the future as it becomes more
                            dependent on services.</p>
                        <p><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Businesses in each of the three sectors rely on each other. For example, in the primary
                            sector cereal farmers rely on bakers in the secondary sector for their sales of wheat.
                            Bakers may depend on advertising agencies in the tertiary sector to produce television
                            adverts for their products. The transport industry in the tertiary sector relies on the oil
                            industry in the primary sector to provide fuel for its vehicles. Workers in both the
                            secondary and tertiary sectors rely on the primary sector for their food. This reliance
                            between sectors is called interdependence. In this case, Hisense may rely on retailers and
                            other distributors to sell its manufactured goods to consumers.</p>
                        <p><strong>4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            De-industrialisation occurs in well-developed countries, such as the USA, Germany, Japan and
                            France. It involves the decline of the manufacturing sector at the expense of the tertiary
                            sector. In the last 20 or 30 years, many western-style economies have seen employment in
                            manufacturing fall sharply. However, at the same time there has been a steady increase in
                            the quantity and value of services.</p>
                        <p><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            A number of suggestions have been suggested to explain the process of de-industrialisation.
                            There may have been a change in consumer demand. People may prefer to spend more of their
                            income on services rather than manufactured goods. For example, people may be spending more
                            on holidays, restaurants, travelling and personal services and less on consumer durables.
                            Competition in manufacturing may be another important reason. Recently there has been some
                            fierce competition in the production of manufactured goods from developing countries such as
                            India, China, Thailand and Brazil. These countries can often produce manufactured goods more
                            cheaply than in western economies. In this case, China has seen an increase in the
                            manufacturing sector. In the last 30 years or so, China has developed a competitive edge in
                            this sector due mainly to its cheap and large supply of labour.</p>
                        <p>Another reason is that as countries become more developed the public sector tends to grow.
                            Since the public sector mainly provides services such as education and transport and
                            healthcare, this adds to the growth of the tertiary sector. Finally, advances in technology
                            mean that employment in manufacturing falls because machines replace people. The reason for
                            the decline in manufacturing in well-developed countries may be different depending on the
                            circumstances of the individual nation. For example, a country that has an inefficient
                            manufacturing sector may be vulnerable to overseas competition. In this case, China, which
                            is still a developing country (although it is developing rather rapidly), has seen an
                            increase in the tertiary sector from 18 per cent to around 42 per cent. This trend is likely
                            to continue in the future as the country develops &ndash; the tertiary sector will grow as
                            it has done in developed nations.</p>
