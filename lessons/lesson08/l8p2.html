                            <li>Put students in pairs and give them 1 minute to discuss the names of the biggest fast food chains that they are aware of.</li>
                            <li>Share findings as a class.</li>
                            <li>Possible answers:</li>
                            <ul class="square">
                            <li>McDonald's</li>
                            <li>KFC</li>
                            <li>Burger King</li>
                            <li>Pizza Express</li>
                            <li>Subway</li>
                            <li>Pizza Hut.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>M</em><em>ost</em><em>large fast food chains offer franchises.</em><em>In 2022, Subway had nearly 40,000 shops </em><em>worldwide,</em><em>and </em><em>the company is less than 50 years old. Similarly, </em><em>McDonald's</em><em> is the largest chain of fast food shops and is also less than 80 years old. Both of these huge chains used a system called <strong>franchising</strong> to allow them to grow to the size they are today. </em><em>KFC and Burger King use this system too.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Franchising is a system where a large</em><em>,</em><em> established business allows a small private business to use its brand name and products to operate a new outlet of that business on behalf of the big business (the <strong>franchisor</strong>). In return for being allowed to benefit from the head-start this give</em><em>s</em><em> small businesses</em><em>,</em><em> they pay the franchisor for the right to use the name. This <strong>franchise fee</strong> is called a <strong>royalty payment.</strong></em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 1 of the slideshow and tell students to make a note of the information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <P>link</P>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tell students: <em>Franchising itself is not a specific form of ownership/legal structure for a company. Most franchisors are public limited companies</em><em>,</em><em> and <strong>franchisees</strong> are small businesses and will usually be sole traders or private limited companies. Therefore, franchising is a method of operating a business that may suit certain large companies and also entrepreneurs.</em></li>
                                <li>Tell students: Many<em> large businesses choose to operate a franchise model because it allows them to grow quickly.</em></li>
                                <li>Explain:<em> This is because they can use enthusiastic entrepreneurs who are looking to set up their own businesses that they can operate and run, but those people m</em><em>ight</em><em>not have a specific </em><em>business idea or feel they </em><em>cannot</em><em> compete with a large chain </em><em>(</em><em>such as the franchisor</em><em>)</em><em>so will choose to operate one of those chain outlets rather than compete against it.</em></li>
                                <li>Tell students: <em>Another reason is that franchising does not require the franchisor to provide as much capital as if the business were opening new branches itself. </em><em>It</em><em> rel</em><em>ies</em><em> on the franchisee to raise most of the money. It is often easier for a small franchisee to do this if banks know they are running a franchise for a large business because this is likely to mean the business is a viable one and they will be able to generate sales because of the well-known brand name.</em></li>
                                <li>Click on Slide 2.</li>
                                <li>Run a quick &lsquo;think, pair, share&rsquo; activity. First, give students 1 minute to consider the question individually (&lsquo;think&rsquo;).</li>
                                <li>Next, give students 1 minute to share the ideas with a partner (&lsquo;pair&rsquo;).</li>
                                <li>Then, invite students to &lsquo;share&rsquo; their ideas as a class before clicking to reveal the answers.</li>
                                <li>Allow students to make a note in their exercise books.</li>
                                <li>Explain that exclusive access to a particular area means that no other branch of that same franchise will be allowed to operate in that area.</li>
                                <li>Tell students: <em>Many franchise businesses operate in countries across the world. The name for a company that does business in more than one country is a <strong>multinational company</strong>, meaning it sell</em><em>s</em><em> its goods, employ</em><em>s</em><em> staff or operate</em><em>s</em><em> factories in lots of different countries. </em><em>The franchisor</em><em> would be seen as the multinational because they are </em><em>a</em><em> large company operating around the globe</em><em>. In contrast,</em><em> a franchisee will only operate in one small area of one country.</em></li>
                                <li>Explain that in return for all of the help listed on Slide 2, franchisors expect certain things from franchisees &ndash; some will be financial, others non-financial.</li>
                                <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                                <li>Give students 1 minute to think of some answers to the question. They should work individually.</li>
                                <li>Ask for suggestions and click to reveal the answers for students to copy.</li>
                                <li>Explain that not all franchises will ask for the same things, but those shown on Slide 3 are fairly standard.</li>
                                <li>Click to show the question on Slide 4.</li>
                                <li>Tell students to write their answers (T/F) on mini whiteboards or pieces of paper and show them when asked.</li>
                                <li>Click to reveal the answer.</li>
                                <li>Ask a student who got the question correct: <em>Can you explain why the correct answer was &lsquo;false&rsquo;?</em> (Answer: The explanation of what happens with franchising was correct, except that the franchisee cannot use the brand name anywhere else in the world except in one particular pre-agreed location.)</li>
                                <li>Click to show the question on Slide 5.</li>
                                <li>Tell students to write their answers (T/F) on a mini whiteboard (or piece of paper) and show them when asked. Remind them to read all parts of the question carefully if the last question caught them out.</li>
                                <li>Click to reveal the answer.</li>                              
                                <li>Ask a student who got the question correct: <em>Can you explain why the correct answer was &lsquo;false&rsquo;?</em> (Answer: The franchisee can get expert support and benefit from gaining a lot of recognition easily as they will use a famous brand name. However, they cannot make all the decisions themselves. The franchisor retains control over how the service is offered, what products to stock and often how much to charge for them.)</p></li></ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>In <strong>Teaching session 1</strong>, some students may struggle with understanding how franchises work. Suggest that they consider a famous brand they know well and explain that a relatively quick and easy way for that brand to grow into new areas is not to do all the work of setting themselves up, but to get another business to do that for them. Stress that franchising is not a form of ownership (which they have seen in previous lessons) but simply a way of doing business. Some of the advantages on p. 23 of the <strong>Student Book</strong> may help students understand &lsquo;why&rsquo; franchising is used.</li>
                                <li>In<strong> Student work 1 (Worksheet 1, </strong>Question 2<strong>)</strong>, some students may struggle to choose a business. Suggest they think about a brand they personally would buy from. For example, Liverpool FC may decide to capitalise on their reputation as a world-leading football club in Thailand and franchise out the opportunity to run Liverpool FC coaching lessons. The franchisee would have to be a football fan and take online coaching courses offered by Liverpool. They would also follow standard training drills and then be able to sell kits it and other merchandise and take a fee for each lesson.</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Now that you understand what a franchise is all about, we need to consider some of the advantages and disadvantages of that form of ownership for both the franchisee and the franchisor.</em></li>

                            <li>Ask students: <em>What might be an advantage to the franchisee?</em> (Possible answer: The franchisee does not need to put in as much capital upfront as if it was their own company.)</li>
                            <li>Give students 1 minute, working with a partner, to think of a disadvantage for each party &ndash; the franchisor and the franchisee.</li>
                            <li>Briefly share ideas as a class. (Possible answers are given on Slide 1 of the slideshow.</li>

                                <li>Give students 3 minutes to decide how they would categorise each statement. They should work individually, noting their answers in their exercise books.</li>
                                <li>Next, give students 2 minutes to compare their answers with a partner, discussing any differences.</li>
                                <li>Then, go through each statement as a class. Ask students for answers. Click to show each answer one by one. Explain any misconceptions where necessary.</li>
                                <li>Click on Slide 2. Ask students to note down this summary.</li>
                                <li>Ask whether students disagreed (within their pairs) on any specific answers. Explain the following:
                                <ul class="square">
                                <li>3 This is a serious problem for the franchisor because it can affect their reputation if unhappy customers post online, but it will also affect the individual franchisee. C or D could, therefore, both be options.</li>
                                <li>4 The biggest issue is that the franchisor has created a famous product and invested so much into developing and marketing it, but another company that only buys and sells that product keeps about 90‒95% of the sales income. B or C could, therefore, both be options.</li>
                                <li>5 The franchisee cannot decide how much to sell a product for or which products to sell. They may also have to keep to certain operating hours and follow rules on uniforms, how to provide the service, train staff etc. However, this can also be a disadvantage for the franchisor because they will lose control over some decisions and find it more difficult to ensure the franchisee is always following all the guidelines exactly. C or D could therefore both be options.</li>
                                <li>8 This method is really low risk for the franchisor as they will get an initial fee, be paid for supplies or materials and also get a percentage of sales without risking any of their own money. However, it could also be low risk for the franchisee as they are almost guaranteed to get a certain number of customers keen on a well-loved brand. A or B could, therefore, both be options.</li>
                                <li>12 Using another company to operate part of your business means that business owners will be motivated to make as much money as they can, so the franchisor will benefit from higher sales. However, this could also be an advantage for the franchisee themselves too. A or B could, therefore, both be options.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>If time allows, ask students: <em>Can you think of any other advantages or disadvantages that have not been covered?</em> Take answers and discuss.</li>
                                <li>Tell students: <em>It is crucial that you understand which features of franchising are beneficial or problematic and can explain why this is the case. This is because in the exam</em><em>,</em><em> you may be asked to suggest the most appropriate way to run a business or whether franchising is a good idea for a </em><em>particular </em><em>business or entrepreneur.

                                <li>In <strong>Student work 2</strong> (<strong>Worksheet 2</strong>, Question 5) some students may struggle to decide which form of ownership Chuks should choose if they cannot remember the features of each. Suggest they use the tables of pros/cons of each form on pp. 21, 22, 29 and 31 of the <strong>Student Book</strong>. If they then struggle to decide on franchising, they can use the table on p. 23 to refresh their memories on the pros/cons of franchising.</li>

                                <li>Entrepreneurs are the business owners, and without these people, businesses would not exist in the private sector. They develop a business idea, invest their own money and start a business.</li>
                                <li>In a franchising operation, the franchisor owns the franchise. Franchisors receive money when they allow others to take out a franchise and trade under their name.</li>

                                Decision-making Organising Risk-taking
                                <li>Many small business owners, such as sole traders and franchisees, have unlimited liability. This is very important because it says something about the risk they take. It means the franchisee is liable for all business debts if the business collapses. The franchisee can be forced to meet these debts from personal wealth. It means a person can lose more than was originally invested in the business. In this case, a Husse franchisee could lose more than the original &pound;10 000 paid to the franchisor before trading began.</li>
                                <li>Taking out a franchise may suit someone who wants to run a business but does not have their own business idea. The Husse franchisor grants the franchisee a licence to trade under the brand name of Husse. In return for &pound;10 000, the Husse franchisee gets various benefits and support. Husse offers benefits such as &pound;2000 of stock for resale, additional materials worth &pound;2000, which includes items such as a Husse tent, signs for a van, catalogues and a two-day in-house training course. Husse franchisees also get an exclusive territory with around 55 000 households. In the first six months, regular money for marketing is provided, and so is support such as advisory services and a development manager. All these benefits are key advantages of operating as a franchisee. There is also less risk when taking out a franchise. Entrepreneurs have to risk their own money to get started. In this case, it costs up to &pound;13 900 to take out a Husse franchise. This is less risky than starting a business alone because the franchisee can trade under an established and successful brand name. In this case, Husse is established in over 50 countries worldwide. Many pet owners will know the &lsquo;tried and trusted&rsquo; brand name. This gives the franchisee a head start and reduces the risk of failure &ndash; a huge advantage. However, taking out a franchise, such as Husse, has disadvantages. In some franchise agreements, profit is shared with the franchisor. For example, it may be necessary to pay an annual commission in addition to the original fee. There is also a lack of independence. Franchisors often require strict operating conditions. For example, a Husse franchisee may not be allowed to trade outside the agreed territory. Finally, it can be an expensive way to start a new business. It may be cheaper to set up a pet food delivery service without using Husse. To conclude, taking out a franchise may benefit those struggling to come up with their own idea, those who want to reduce some of the risks in business and those who are happy to sacrifice some independence.</li>
