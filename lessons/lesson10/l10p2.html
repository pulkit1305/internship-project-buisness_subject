                                they should focus on the businesses, rather than their owners.</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Who can suggest a non-financial objective that some private sector
                                    businesses may want to achieve? </em>(Answer: Social objectives)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Who can remember what we meant by social objectives </em>(previously
                                taught in <strong>Lesson 2</strong>)?<em> Can you give me some examples?</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>Although many companies might try to achieve these objectives while
                                    also seeking to make profits, some organisations focus on achieving these types of
                                    objective as their primary reason for existence. Examples include Oxfam, which
                                    focuses on eliminating poverty in countries across the world, Shonaquip, which helps
                                    promote the inclusion of families with disabled children into their communities in
                                    South Africa and St Pauli, which is a sports club in Hamburg, Germany that is owned
                                    by its 30,000 members and has five guiding principles to set out how it will support
                                    its members and local community.</em></li>

                                <ol class="l2" style="margin-left: 3%;">
                                    <li><em>A common form of social enterprise is a <strong>charity</strong>. Many
                                            charities exist to raise money for, or awareness of, a specific good cause
                                            within society. This could be protecting a local green space or seeking a
                                            cure for malaria. Charities raise money by inviting donations from members
                                            of the public, other businesses or governments and then, once they have paid
                                            their operating costs, spend the surplus on supporting the specific cause
                                            they raised the money for. </em></li>
                                    <li><em>Charities raise money in different ways. Some seek to promote the importance
                                            of their cause and so provide a strong argument for why members of the
                                            public should donate to support their activities. Examples include the World
                                            Widelife Fund (set up to protect nature) and the Red Cross Society of China
                                            (founded as a humanitarian organisation). Others sell certain goods or
                                            services and so generate a profit from this part of their operations which
                                            is used to fund the social campaigns that are the &lsquo;mission&rsquo; of
                                            the company. For example, Yayasan Solemen in Indonesia runs a &lsquo;smile
                                            shop&rsquo; selling donated new or pre-loved goods to raise funds for poor
                                            households where family members have disabilities.</em></li>

                            <li>Tell students: A<em>nother form of social enterprise is the
                                    <strong>cooperative</strong>. Cooperatives are formed to support the needs of a
                                    particular group, such as customers or workers. </em></li>
                            <li>Click to reveal the third bullet on Slide 2.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> In the UK, the Cooperative Group (Co-op) is owned by its members who
                                    each pay &pound;1 to join. This makes those members the &lsquo;owners&rsquo; of the
                                    cooperative, which provides groceries, funeral, banking and insurance services.
                                    Members receive discounts on Co-op&rsquo;s products and services. They also share
                                    decision-making and the profits are re-distributed to those members who can then
                                    spend their share in the company&rsquo;s shops. This is an example of a customer, or
                                    <strong>consumer cooperative</strong>.</em></li>
                            <li><em>Click to reveal the fourth bullet on Slide 2.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> There are also <strong>retail cooperatives</strong>, which are when
                                    groups of independently owned shops work together to source the goods that they
                                    sell. In this way they can benefit from economies of scale by purchasing stock in
                                    much larger quantity than the individual member shops could do if they bought it
                                    independently. This allows them to compete with larger companies on the basis of
                                    cost. In the USA, ShopRite is a retail cooperative brand under which 50 different
                                    private businesses work together to buy groceries for the 300 or more stores that
                                    operate under the ShopRite name, which consumers come to trust due to the fact it is
                                    seen as a single larger business by most consumers. </em></li>

                            <li>Tell students:<em> Another form of cooperative is a <strong>worker cooperative</strong>.
                                    In India the Urulungal Labour Co-operative is owned and managed by workers who
                                    created the business to build important infrastructure, such as transport systems,
                                    housing and agriculture. This provides paid work and guarantees reasonable working
                                    conditions and a say in the projects workers carry out. It also ensures that
                                    important projects get built because they are the ones most needed by the
                                    community.</em></li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 3.</li>
                            <li>Give students 3 minutes to match the features to the forms of social enterprise. They
                                should work individually.</li>
                            <li>Go through the features one-at-a-time, asking students to show answers on a mini
                                whiteboard before clicking to reveal the correct answer.</li>
                            <li>Click on Slide 4.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:<em> The word <strong>stakeholder</strong> refers to any party that is
                                    affected by the operations of a business or organisation. We learned about
                                    shareholders in <strong>Lesson 6</strong>. They are people who own a portion or a
                                    &lsquo;share&rsquo; of a company</em></li>
                            <li>Give students 2 minutes to identify the key features of a social enterprise (of any
                                kind). They should work in pairs.</li>
                            <li>Warn students that they need to read the features carefully. Some relate to private
                                companies and not to social enterprises so they should not list those.</li>
                            <li>Ask a student to suggest an answer and continue until all features have been identified.
                                As you do so, discuss any misconceptions. This may involve clarifying the following
                                points:
                                <ol class="l2" style="margin-left: 3%;">
                                    <li>Accountable and transparent: a private company will usually seek to keep certain
                                        information private rather than allow rivals to understand how it runs. A social
                                        enterprise is likely to want to promote the way it is run and the basis for
                                        decision-making in order to justify what it does to its members, donors or the
                                        wider public.</li>
                                    <li>Income generation: social enterprises rely on donations or income from selling
                                        goods and services, while private companies can raise large amounts of money by
                                        selling shares etc.</li>
                                    <li>Objectives: the main goal of private businesses is presumed to be making a
                                        profit for the owners (or possibly growing the size of the business to increase
                                        its value so it can be sold at a profit).</li>

                                what is supposed to be the primary goal of private business &ndash; to create the
                                maximum financial return for the owners &ndash; and then avoid those features as they do

                                    <li>The company may be able to charge a higher price because consumers

                                    <li>Charities often pay lower or no tax and so can offer lower prices and

                                run your society but I would suggest having one leader who will be responsible for the
                                class, ultimately ensuring it meets all of the requirements and helps to support
                                decision-making. This leader would probably also be supported in government by some
                                ministers who might be responsible for helping the groups that might be chosen to focus
                                on different aspects of Terra 2&rsquo;s activities. Examples could be as follows but it

                                    <li>To establish the essential services that the society is going to require as it
                                        grows from 240 to 2,000 people.</li>
                                    <li>To focus on the best way to provide these services (considering whether public
                                        ownership, private companies or social enterprises will be the best way of
                                        delivering and managing these services).</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tell students that it is up to them how they carry out the activity but achieving the
                                goals is crucial. They should also ensure they establish an inclusive society where the
                                views of all citizens are valued and their participation is encouraged.</li>
                            <li>Tell students they have 18 minutes to come up with notes for a proposal for how to
                                organise the society and will need to choose someone/some people who will (briefly)
                                present their decisions after that time. Students will present their proposal in the
                                <strong>End-of-lesson activity</strong>.

                                think about the social cause that they care most about and then to try to think about
                                how they would feel and behave towards a business that seeks to achieve those types of
                                goals.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Social enterprises aim to improve human and environmental well-being rather than make a
                                profit for owners. Generally, social enterprises have a clear social and/or
                                environmental mission. They generate most of their income through trade or donations and
                                reinvest most of their profits. They are majority controlled in the interests of the
                                social mission and are accountable and transparent. In this case, Save the Children aims
                                to improve the well-being of children across the world. In particular, Save the Children
                                raises money to run world-class programmes to save children&rsquo;s lives and challenge
                                world leaders to keep to their promises to give children a brighter future.</li>
                            <li>Most charities rely on gifts and donations to fund their social activities. In this case
                                Save the Children raises very large amounts of money globally. In 2015, it generated
                                around US$2100 million. According to the pie chart in Figure 3.2 a large proportion of
                                this money came from institutions and governments &ndash; 58 per cent. The next largest
                                source was from individual donations &ndash; 25 per cent. Individuals are often generous
                                when giving to causes that protect the interests of children. Corporations and
                                foundations are another important source. This might be companies and special charitable
                                foundations. Save the Children is a large international charity. Smaller charities might
                                organise fund-raising events such as cake sales, sponsored activities and selling
                                greetings cards. Some also run business ventures, such as charity shops.</li>
